"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,MzzzzSusan in SC,True,5,"LOVE THE NOTE 3. I really love the Galaxy Note 3 and I have had absolutely no problems with it. It does everything and more. I am sorry the newest version (7) has been such a disaster, but I think there must have been a flaw in the sealed waterproof design. I am so glad I settled on the older version, tried and true, for less money, and virtually no down side at all. The Galaxy Note 3 phone is such an awesome phone I feel very badly for the company at this time. Also the company which sent it, did so quickly. Arrived earlier than expected.",5.0,11-10-2016,7.0,545
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Teresa Fong,True,5,"ATTENTION TRACFONE USERS. Amazingly this works with Tracfone. Before we used a iPhone 4s Verizon, bought from Amazon and transferred to Tracfone BYOP successfully and everything still works today. Didn't know of Tracfone's changes, so now it's AT&T, unlocked phones, T-Mobile, and some other various carriers that can be brought into BYOP, not Verizon! (As it was a BYOP carrier before) TRANSFER: Old Tracfone cellphone to this newer samsung. Already had a Sim card meant for the process. (Strangely before the iPhone 4s didn't need a Sim card, still doesn't have one, but still on that Tracfone plan for the iPhone). The BYOP process didn't work right away when we tried transferring it online. Called Tracfone for assistance, blah blah provided information, this that, op nope your phone isn't compatible with Tracfone sorry, and bye. HOWEVER, we tried transferring online again and it worked successfully!! RESULTS: It uses AT&T cell towers, makes calls and everything successfully, Image transfers through text messages is iffy since it can't send multiple images in bulk. Just make sure to go through the steps listed for BYOP, do it once or twice and Image transfer along with data usage should work fine.",1.0,14-07-2016,3.0,1211
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Michele,True,5,"I love this phone/table phablet!. This phone is fabulous! I had an iPhone 4, and really didn't need anything fancy or better but got tired of the updates and being it was a 4, it was too old for many newer things. I wanted something that I could read books on that is large enough like a kindle, but use as a phone as well. This phone is it for me. Phablet.....yeah ok. I call it awesome! Perfect in size to read books, not too big that it still is ok to use as phone while holding it up to your ear. It is bigger than most phones, but with all the features as hands-free, gestures and so many features I am still learning about, I recommend this to anyone wanting the cross between a tablet and a cell phone. Many others give great detail to the phone, I am simply going to say its fast, battery lasts longs (if you remember to close applications you're not using) so many smart features, and way better than iPhone 4. I love android and all the same apps pretty much as iTunes has plus google play store, kindle app for books........its endless!! Love it!",3.0,20-01-2015,5.0,1057
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Mike,True,5,"Worked Great, No Accessories. Worked just like it was straight out of the box. It was great to be able to charge again after my original Note 3 was rusted and corroded around the port. It was a little tricky to figure out how to change out the SIM card. Apparently according to YouTube videos you need the tool which came in the original box. There is no way that you could do it by hand, I had no luck with a pair of tweezers, and even with the original tool took me a few attempts to get the SIM card out. Once put in the new phone I didn't even have to call Verizon, it worked immediately. I also purchased a 128GB Memory Stick to transfer all of my photos and videos from the old phone (It's memory was full so I couldn't upload through the internet and the port was corroded so USB wouldn't work). This phone did not come with the Stylus or the Charger. I found two generic chargers for about $8 on Amazon and I took my stylus from the old phone. Overall happy with the purchase and everything worked great. Only downside in the whole experience for me was that I lost some of my contacts in the transfer. I believe that some are stored locally on the phone and some are google contacts. There didn't seem to be much rhyme or reason but I now make sure that I store them all as Google contacts..",2.0,18-04-2017,4.0,1300
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,vdctech,True,4,"VERY Pleased with this phone!!. I have had this phone for a little over a month now and am extremely happy with it. I love everything about it EXCEPT the Visual Voicemail Update that WONT GO AWAY. I DO NOT want Visual Voicemail and besides that, Verizon wants to charge 2.99 a month for it!! I won't go into this any further as it will just spark more rants about unwanted software/bloat ware. The problem with this particular piece of crapware is that notifications CONTINUALLY pop up and sit in the notifications bar at the top of the phone. If you clear it, it comes back, and there is no way to turn it off either! This is the reason for taking off 1 star off the phone¡¦s rating. Other than that, the phone is a real performer, takes wonderful pictures and video and is still slim enough to fit nicely in my back pocket. The phone is big, but so are my hands and it could not fit them better. This is truly a ¡§where have you been all my life¡¨ moment having this phone. The larger display is just awesome and the pen works great too. This phone would be a perfect 10+ without the software/bloat ware thing. But hey, where would the world be without annoying salespeople trying to sell you what you don¡¦t want or need? Anyway, the battery life has been great for me. Most times I can go 2 days without a charge. I do turn my phone off at night though and I don¡¦t play games on it with the exception of Bubble Shootº. I went from the Droid Razr Maxx to this phone and I loved that phone, well I thought I did until I got this phone. I was hesitant going away from Motorola equipment, as I have always had some sort of Motorola device because they are made so well. REALLY glad I made this switch!!",1.0,04-06-2014,3.0,1703
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Joseph,True,5,"Still learning, transitioning from iPhone. Great phone, although I miss the integrated features that the iPhone provides. Excellent battery. I haven't found aftermarket apps, but in my transition i've noticed: What I do love: Great screen size to read everything comfortably, watch video clips, and appreciate pictures. Great battery life. I had to charge the iPhone I had twice a day. This I abuse and it still gets me through the day. It also has a removable battery for instant juice. Family I have in the Philippines have had to charge theirs 3-4 times a day due to the network infrastructure. Responsive In my transition, things I have noticed: -Native list syncing is not present. I decided to go with Wunderlist. I would have used Google Task, but it's not developed yet. -No button that pulls up voice command like Siri does in the lock screen. The voice command is not universal and not as easily accessible like Siri was. You can have it activate in the lock screen with a double tap of the home button, but it doesn't work if the phone is unlocked. If it is unlocked, you have to find the app. There is a buttonless voice activation (""Hi Galaxy""), but it stops working sometimes. -Google maps will persist in lock mode, but only if you don't hit the home button to summon the unlock screen. When you do that, the map disappears and you must unlock the phone to see it again (the iPhone will always show the map when navigating while locked, which was really nice). -Some apps tend to freeze. I simply hold down the home button and swipe to close a running program and then reopen it. -The text size kept changing on me every time I tried to text. I found you change the default text size with the volume buttons. -I had to be creative to migrate my contacts. I moved everything to Google from my iPhone, then synced with my phone. One thing that is great is that I can manage my contacts now through Google Contacts through my Gmail (they have a tool to remove duplicate contacts! -Text to speech engine is awesome, better than Siri in accuracy and speed, I think. -Camera and playlist controls aren't available in the lock screen as they were with the iPhone, UNLESS you disable security. I've used the pen when in phone calls to jot down and auto-call the numbers I write afterwards, which is really nice. After the novelty of the pen, I reverted to using the on-screen keyboard. I still use it on occasion. I like the availability, especially when sending information to people or writing on maps. I have used the S-Note notebooks to draw guitar chords and strumming patterns, so that's really nice. I just wish there was more integration, so I can see my notebooks on my computer. For a case, I used the Otterbox Commuter, which works well. It has no belt clip, but I would imagine I'd get tired of putting on the clip after a while anyway. This just slides into my pocket. Did I enjoy my iPhone? yes. simple, works, well integrated, robust, although sometimes non-responsive and poor battery life. Do I enjoy the Galaxy Note? yes. Totally different experience with the larger screen, great battery life, more enjoyment of pictures, video. It's not as well integrated, but it works and does what I want. In a mobile computing device/phone that I have on me all the time the screen, snappiness, battery life, and pen bring really make it and are much more important in the experience. Will I stay? I think so. I will learn the phone soon enough. The experience is just different. If you have any comments, please do! I'm still learning the phone. It is a great piece of art and master craftsmanship from Samsung. It comes from South Korea, a powerhouse of cutting edge technology and force in the global economy (I was there for a year and can appreciate the history). Not to be confused with China or Japan",1.0,08-03-2014,3.0,3821
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,eg,True,5,"Favorite smartphone Ive had.. This is definitely the best phone I've owned. My previous were the Samsung Fascinate (Galaxy 1) and then the Galaxy S3. I have always prefered Samsung devices. I like Apples hardware but I hate iOS, so I stick to android devices. After working several jobs selling cell phones, and working with them all the time I always choose to buy samsung. I just think the Galaxy series phones have been really good. Well, the time came for my S3 to upgrade and I was planning on getting the newest ""S"" phone which at the time was the S5. After playing around with one for a bit I just wasn't crazy about it. It seemed bigger than my S3 by a noticeable amount, and had some annoying features that were unable to be turned off. I didn't care about the S Health or anything like that. I care about speed, and features. Thats where the Note shines. It is a large phone, but its actually not that much bigger than an S5. An S5 with an otterbox is bigger than my Note with a slim grip case. I have now had the phone for a couple months and pocketing it is no big deal at all. Also the Note has awesome features. S-Window is really cool, as well as Scrapbooker. S-note is useful for reminders or jotting down a number or something really quick. S-draw is really cool to use. The pen even comes in handy for texting and normal web use. Its screen is also really nice not quite 1080p but its 720p. It looks just fine I watch videos on it all the time. all in all I highly recommend the Note 3. The Note 4 hardware and build quality/materials are better. Its more expensive and has some slightly annoying features though. Consider a Note as your next phone over a Galaxy S. Not to m",0.0,12-01-2015,2.0,1692
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Judy L.,True,5,"So far I am really loving this phone.. I don't use a cell phone a lot, but I love the functionality of this phone. It is more like a mini tablet. The pen that comes with it is very handy, and activates the phone when you pull it out. It is also great for more precise selections and for note taking. I am very happy with the resolution of the screen and the response of both touch and pen. Buying the phone from Amazon and setting up a new Verizon account was painless. I easily got the account and on-line payment set up without a hitch. I also transferred my AT&T phone number to the phone without any problems. I won't reiterate the tech specs of the phone as you can read all of that on the product page. I just want to let you know what I think of it as a user of the phone. At this point in time, I couldn't be happier with this phone or the Verizon service. UPDATE 5/07/16 I've had this phone for a little over 3 years, and I still have no desire to get a new phone. I did, however, recently decide to switch my service provider from Verizon to T-Mobile because of the offerings of T-Mobile which I won't get into. I was assured by the T-Mobile rep that as long as the phone was unlocked, I could replace the Verizon sim card with the one from T-Mobile and the phone would work with no problems after activating the T-Mobile sim card. I am updating this review so that others don't experience what I did if they want to change their provider. First of all, Verizon has never locked any of their 4G phones. Verizon uses a CDMA network which is also used by Sprint and US Cellular, T-Mobile and AT&S use a GSM network. One difference is the polarity used, so phone for each type of network are manufactured to use the specific polarity of the network. The other difference that should be considered by the end user is that on the GSM network customer information is stored on the sim card. This means that you can take the sim card from one phone and insert it into another and it will work.GSM carriers must accept any GSM phone. So they don't have control over the phone you are using. CDMA carriers use network based white lists. So you can only switch phones with your carrier's permission, and the carrier doesn't have to accept any particular phone. There are other differences between the two network types, but those I have mentioned affect the end user the most. In my case, I had to buy a new phone in order to switch to T-Mobile as a carrier. I was also told by Verizon that this phone ""may"" work with another CDMA carrier, but it my lose functionality. I have had to buy another phone to use the GSM network, and have decided to get the Galaxy Note 4 since I have to give up my Note 3. I hope this helps other in choosing a carrier and a phone.",1.0,08-01-2014,3.0,2761
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Renie,True,5,"Great camera and sound, large, but slim. durable. 'rich' looking.. best phone I've had so far. switched from AT&T to Verizon with this phone, and glad I did, customer service has been excellent. there were problems with overheating and the battery draining quickly - which you can see via an internet search - Verizon replaced the phone, but I found that the problem really seems tied to Google updating/syncing photos and videos - once I turned that off (and only do it on demand and when plugged in) the problem seems solved. have not been thrilled by the Note feature, but that is probably just my ignorance. Excellent camera, and I love the Google voice search/response feature (of course, that's an android, not just the Note 3). I am fairly careful with my phones, so haven't put a screensaver on it, nor do I use a case (most of the time) due to the weight - and find the phone and screen to be pretty durable, it still looks like new after about 2 years. it's large, and rather unwieldy, but for my old eyes, ability to see things on the screen makes up for it! it is slim and light enough to not be a problem. the sound is really good too, I almost always use the speakerphone on it for making calls, and like the sound when I play music or listen to audio books (and I'm fussy!). I haven't tried other brands, so can't comment on how the note 3 compares, tho I did look at them in the store before settling on this phone",0.0,02-07-2015,2.0,1430
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Engee00,True,5,"Great Phone. I bought this phone in December 2013. l still love it. The drawback is its size. l hare small hands and it can be difficult to grasp because it is big.It is also heavier than my previous phones. The size is why I bought it though - l wanted the big screen and it is worth it. lt is very durable. I did put a case on it but it is a lightweight one that only covers the edges and back. I have dropped my phone many times with no damage. Samsung does have a lot of useless programs that come pre-installed but I haven't had issues with those. My battery easily lasts all day most days. If the battery seems to be draining quickly, clearing the cache and restarting the phone seems to solve the problem. The On-screen keyboard is easier to use on the bigger screen. The split windows are now useable. Games are easier to play. Everything is easier to read. One more drawback is that the volume buttons and power button are directly opposite of each other. I often end up pressing both at the same time. The rest of the phone isn't much different from the Galaxy Nexus. the programs are the same. The screens look the same only bigger.",1.0,11-07-2014,3.0,1143

I have been waiting since November 2012 to get my hands on one of these I would frantically search to see the latest stats, pro's and cons and I must say the phone is PERFECT!!! I am AMAZED at how HUGE the screen is all the while the phone is SOOOO LIGHTWEIGHT!! It is very slim and feels as if nothing is in my hand. I have toyed with some things at first glance the Graphics have my pupils like WOOOOOOW..... I made the tragic mistake of bluetoothing over all my pics from my previous phone first before downloading apps and its about 1200 photos, videos and music.. My fault for that(drained my battery) but Other than that on first hand I Love, Love, Love, Love my new phone!!!! =) 1/25/14 It is nice to have a phone that can go 1 day and a half without being on charge. I took phone off Charge at 745am. Worked 13 hours and went out to the bar after work took pics, and mild to moderate social networking while at work (shhh...lol and went to sleep with battery at 33% woke up 7 hours later phone is on 30%!!!

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Angelia Hall-David Hall,True,5,"Best phone I've ever owned. This phone does everything I could ask of it. I'm a student and this thing is absolutely amazing for taking notes, editing documents, reading...etc. I also love to play games which it will handle everything out there. I would not say that this phone is for everybody because of its shear size and capabilities...my 60 year old father would not be able to figure this thing out because of all the customization it offers. Beware, this phone is extremely big...like comically big. Unless you have Andre The Giant hands, you probably wont be able to reach from one end of the screen to the other while one handed texting, with that being said, I am always worried that I will drop it; so i suggest always using both hands. I am a very heavy user so the battery usually lasts me about an entire day with about 15% left, but I like my brightness maxed out, wifi on, games, syncing, blah blah blah. My old Galaxy S3 would require a charge in the middle of the day just to make it to the end of the day with how much I use it.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Lexi H.,True,5,"Love the phone!!!. First of all, I want to say that Amazon price beats any service provider offers out there. Secondly, the quick shipment from amazon and processing is awesome. Now the phone, I love love love everything about it. It is big in size, but how many people have a smartphone plus a tablet. I find this phone serves the purpose of both. I love how everything is in one. I was always in love with the Android operating system, so I never really had much of a problem. I found I got really frustrated with Apple products a lot, and switching to the iPhone was the biggest regret I had made. I just don't like how everything is set up for you and you can't really customize anything. Secondly, I love how the Note syncs with my Google account, from my Gmail to my calendar and my contacts. I am currently taking online classes, and I am able to log on to my school website without a problem. As opposed to my iPhone I can only access certain features, and not to mention constantly having to zoom in.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Samuel M Gillespie,True,5,"UPDATE!!!! DO NOT INSTALL UPDATE TO ANDROID 5.0 LOLLIPOP. Update!!!! Last week (April 28, 2015) Verizon pushed the Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the Note 3. DO NOT INSTALL THE UPDATE!!!!! There have been multiple problems with the update. My particular problem has been if the phone is in a no coverage area for a length of time, when you get back into a coverage area it will not pick the signal back up until you reboot the phone.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Jcare,True,5,"Beautiful Phone. Well worth the money. You won't regret it.. Quick reference review: (details below) Fantastic all around! beautifully crisp screen in full HD, very quick response time for all around performance from texts to apps to games. Battery life is astounding, average users will have no problem going throughout a day on one battery, or even two. Connection on Verizon is fast, for both Data and Calls. I haven't experience any call quality issues. Camera qualities are second to none. The S-pen is a nice feature to have. Phone layout/buttons is easy to get used too. I can use this phone easily with one hand, but I have big hands in general. If your only issue with this phone is its size, GET IT. You easily get used to the size and don't even notice it (however i wouldnt recommend to individuals with tiny hands). Comment with any other questions ill try to get back as quick as I can. Bought this phone off amazon in january (2 months ago) due to its amazing deal and reduced price and I am not at all dissatisfied. Worth noting, I purchased this phone over the LG G2. I do have a single significant complaint on this phone regarding the charger, scroll to the bottom for that. Design: The layout and physical features of this phone are fantastic. While it may not be encased in a solid block of metal, you never feel like your holding a cheap phone. The materials are very sturdy and well made, especially when one utilizes a case. In my opinion, being able to access the battery, sim, microSD in the back of the phone is more useful than it being in a solid metal body. The phone itself is incredibly thin. I purchased a Spigen slim hardcase for the phone because I wanted to keep the phone sleek and thin as designed. Button placement is very intuitive and easy to get used too. Hardware: This phone is fast. All the benchmark tests do not lie. This thing performs better than any phone i've had and is faster than my 1st gen Samsung Galaxy Tab. I like to get the most out of my phones, to the point of unlocking them, but even with all of the pre-loaded bloat-apps this thing still flys. Great on WiFi or LTE. Screen is amazingly clear, with great contrast and color. Buttons are firm and don't feel like they're going to break. The speakers are good, not great. They get the job done for most users watching youtube or listening to music occasionally. If you're a hardcore music lover and sound quality is a top priority, you may want to look elsewhere. Touch screen sensitivity is great out of the box. I've had no issues. UI and software: If you've ever used an andriod or samsung device before, you'll quickly find yourself comfortable with this phone. If you've never used it before, it is easy and very enjoyable. I always recommend it over iOS, But I don't have enough experience with Windows to sway you from it. But the User Interface is intuitive and for the most part can be understood by most. There are so many customization's. From different widgets, layouts, screens, you have so many options to satisfy the most eclectic or OCD personalities. Camera: So many phones have crazy camera features or settings, while the average user wont notice or use half of them. I will say, the picture quality and useful features on this phone can be handy. From action shots to selfies to posting your lunch to instragram this phone with suffice for most! I always say if you want to really take meaningful pictures, buy a DSLR! Size: The size of this phone always seems to be the sticky issue with people. As I mentioned before, if size is the only issue holding you back from this phone, JUST GET IT. 99% of your wont be disappointed, and will quickly get used to the phone. Depending on your size, it will be easier than others. The average male wouldn't have a problem with it in his pocket. For reference I am about 6 foot and average build with larger hands. I'm always amazed how often I don't even feel it. However, for smaller individuals it may be an issue. My honest opinion is find one in person. I went to BestBuy and the Samsung rep allowed me to hold his work Note3. I was able to get a real sense of size and feel of it in my pocket, and not just attached to a display table. I love having a larger screen, it just makes it that much easier to use and enjoy, and to me outweighs any size inconvenience. Battery Life: It's amazing. The big size means samsung is able to throw a big battery in it. So even though the larger screen uses more power, many average users wont have a problem going an entire day on one charge. on average i get about a day and a half. If i use heavy (constant screen on) for several hours straight, then i'll run the battery down in a day. But idle in your pocket with LTE on all day. You'll have no issues. The USB 3.0 charger/port is fantastic. This thing charges so fast. I can get a full charge in half the time as my old HTC Thunderbolt. People complain about the thickness of the cord, but its required for the phone to charge that fast, safely. Which brings me to my only issue i've had with this phone... My only complaint: I had a few issues charging my phone. At first I was extremely upset as I thought the port inside my phone was defective. Essentially, with the USB 3.0 cord and charger, you get 2 connections in one. The standard USB port, and an extra smaller port which is why your able to achieve such fast charging and data transfers. My issue was that one of the 2 connections on the USB3 wasn't getting a solid contact in my phone. This lead to longer charge times and my phone telling me ""Please use the original charger that came with your phone for faster charging"". I simply bought a new cord on amazon and i haven't had any problems since. I recommend to anyone having charging issues to first try another cord, as my issue was that the connection to the phone on the cord, was slightly bent. On the other side, its worth noting you CAN indeed charge this phone with regular phone micro USB cords, however it will be slow. Overall, JUST GET THIS PHONE. I can't state it enough, it is really a fantastic phone. I fought back and forth whether to get this or the LG G2 for cheaper, but I decided I wanted the best phone I could buy (at ~$250 for the best phone on the market? that's fairly priced) and would last me a long time, and more importantly keep me preoccupied, and not wanting to buy a new phone before my upgrade.",0.0,27-03-2014,2.0,6411
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Stuffologist,True,5,"As described. My first one crashed on its automatic attempt to update the software. Amazon in their usual pleasant and expedited means, shipped a replacement and walked through some manual steps to ensure the new data contract matched he new phone. I LOVE the stylus and the apps, the size, the features. This is my 2nd favorite device next to the 12 inch Galaxy Note Tablet. When Apple quit updating my perfectly operable 1st gen iPad, I RAN into the arms of Android. In the time I left Android for favor of my iPad, they have come so far and surpass iOS. Sadly, I feel like iPad and iPhones are mere toys in comparison. They are great gadgets but the Galaxy Note line lets someone have fun AND get work done. I can multitask like a nut on this thing.

Visually the phone was in great condition besides a few spots about 1mm in length in the lower right bezzel where the plastic has been chipped. Everything came as described and in working condition, I was able to pop my sim csrd in and activste it thr same day. In the past month, I've experienced a few kinks in the OS like the touchscreen not responding for a few seconds and ohone froze once but nothing that a restart couldn't fix. I dont think that this is a problem with the phone but just a byproduct of its aging (3 year old) componants. But these things only happened twice in the last month after heavy usage so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Overall, getting this phone with its processing power and display was a very good deal for under $200. Despite its age it functions are fluid and dont seem to be slowing down at the moment.

The picture quality on the screen is breathtaking. I have watched so many HD videos. It does allow for split screen and doing multiwork. For example I can split screen and have txt messages on one side and web browser on the other. I can also get on the internet and search something while talking on the phone with someone. And don't forget the stylus! I had some people tell me it was gimmicky but I really like it.

The phone is beautiful and is just what I wanted. The price was right and the delivery time was excellent. The only issue I had was that I did not know that I needed to call Verizon first before it would activate. It seems like Amazon could mention that step when they sell a new phone. Even Verizon did not mention it in the accompanying paperwork that came with the phone. After several unsuccessful attempts to activate the phone, which is supposed to be automated, I went to the Verizon website and found a number I should call prior to letting the phone run the auto-setup and activate the phone.

Everything has worked perfectly from the time I opened it put of the box, and I received exactly why was promised. My girl friend wanted a phone that would be better than the generic $40.00 go phone that could be purchased for her carrier, and what we got was many folds greater. S pen was perfect. Phone was without a blemish. She literally can't stop taken pictures with this phone because Samsungs camers rock. The only down side that I would have to say is that the battery performance is quite poor, but that would be expected if it was the original battery that game with the phone on a older model. I plan on buying a battery for a good deal off amazon for this phone in new condition, which should fix all off her problems I rated this 5 stars to be nice, but in all reality I would give this a 4 out of 5 for the lack of battery porformance.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Derrick,True,5,"This is a superb choice for those seeking a new phone and also for those who want a tablet and phone in one device.. This is an amazing phone/phablet! It has a super-HD screen and also comes with a stylus inside a slot on the phone itself. The screen area is very large and the speakers are adequate but headphones are suggested if watching video. It has multi-screen so that users can have two of certain applications open at the same time and in split screen, such as Gallery and Chrome or Maps and Gmail. It has 3 GBs of RAM and is FAST! A CASE is needed but not a screen protector as the screen is Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and scratch-resistant but not scratch-proof. If one does not put his or her vehicle keys in the same pocket as the device, the screen shouldn't get any scratches. I bought a screen protector the same day as when I purchased the phone but have now gone two weeks (out of three months' ownership) without a single scratch. I do highly recommend downloading a home screen launcher, such as the one I use called Buzz Launcher, because the programmed home screen is just ugly and cluttered. After some experimenting, one will discover which applications you can (and should) turn off to free up RAM. Overall, this is a highly rated phone by professional websites and, if not mistaken, the best-selling phone in the world right now for a reason. This phone is much better than the Galaxy S5 and Google Nexus 5. Another reason I bought this ""phablet"" is so I wouldn't also have to spend money on a separate tablet such as the Google Nexus 7 since this is only 1.3 inches smaller and also has a much better as well as HD screen.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,The Drake,True,5,"Very Nice capabilities and very future proof. Finally after years of waiting, a phone with practically everything that I want and need seems to be here. I've had this phone for over 2 months and it has a Large and high quality display yet easy to hold in one hand, powerful (future proof), long battery life, good sound quality and clarity on both speakers, Infrared TV remote, good camera, USB 3.0 speeds, support for latest wireless standards and optional SD card. I hope bug/performance fixes get released in a timely manner unlike with my Verizon GNexus. Might need to be patient and give the phone a few days—I got a replacement and for the 1st 3 or 4 charges the battery would drain easily to 50% after 9 hours of usage and I was not even using the same amount of features as with the 1st phone nor even using it as much, but it improved over time. The 1st phone did not have this issue and right out of the box would have only dropped to 80% after the same usage and only dropped 2% or 3% overnight instead of 4% to 6% like with the current one. Positives: Battery Life Charge Times Screen Size Sound Quality of both speakers -- so nice not to hear chipmunks anymore Signal Quality (wifi and LTE) Camera Quality in decent lighting Phone stays cool during heavy usage (gaming, phone calls, etc) Overall Keyboard Layout Negatives: Intermittent unexplained battery drainage—Maybe NSA is spying on me? :) Auto-corrections on native keyboard The way that the Phone and Contacts features work—should be simpler to use with a screen this size but requires 2 hands or might be more suited to left-handed people with large hands Intermittent TouchWiz feature malfunctions (s voice, gestures, 1 handed mode, etc) Inability to remember audio settings for head set and constant prompts about volume safety--I only use audio jack while in the car connected to a cassette adapter (not earphones) since I don't have Bluetooth or any native support for smart phones in my car. Some Notes: TouchWiz adds much needed functionality to native android that is nice, but I’ve turned off a lot of the features because some were overkill for my needs and too unreliable for every-day use. I only have prior experience with Native android and Cyanogenmod and although I prefer TouchWiz over Native android, it still needs some serious work. For instance, I find that the swipe to the left or right to message or call a contact works intermittently along with some of the other advertised features such as Smart Stay, S Voice, Hand Gestures, etc, so I’ve turned most of them off and only enable some while using hands free mode while driving or at home. It is also more difficult to do some of the most basic of tasks using TouchWiz Battery Life and charge times with stock charger is very nice although at times since I got my replacement Note 3 it seems like something drains the battery much faster than with the 1st one—going to eventually reset phone to see if it is some kind of OS malfunction. With normal drainage I can usually go for 2 or 3 days on a single charge with what I consider moderate usage (Hangouts chatting, phone calls, iHeartRadio, gaming, and watching videos). Considering that I have a larger screen than I had before, use more of the phone’s features and for longer periods of time while running TouchWiz; I’m impressed. The battery is not even 2x the capacity of my GNexus which would have required 2 charges daily with the same kind of usage on Native android or Cyanogenmod. The screen is fantastic and I’ve enjoyed watching both 1080p and 720p videos without problems—native player can handle most video formats, but does NOT have the same support for audio encoding. Phone feels light weight and although it is aesthetically pleasing to look at, the materials feel kind of cheap so I’ve invested in a cheap case to prolong the aesthetics. Things that I don’t like: I currently know 2 other people who’ve bought this phone and 1 of them along with myself had to get replacements. My 1st one had issues with USB3.0 connectivity, a faulty charging cable, strange tapping sound during phone calls, and a few other bugs. The other party had issues with the charging port—not sure if the 3rd person had issues. My friend that always buys Samsung phones says that the issues with charging ports are common, but this is only my 2nd Samsung phone so I cannot say for sure if this is the case. Auto-correct and word suggestions on native keyboard are a pain to use and so unnatural. I’m used to pressing the back key to have my words reset to what I initially typed in the event that auto-correct is not needed, but with this keyboard you are sometimes presented with a undo button and sometimes you just have to get creative and use the Sym button or write with the stylus pen to bypass the auto-corrections—this is a major flaw in my opinion and should have been fixed by now considering that several updates have been released for the apps and the phone itself. Should not take so much effort to type on a touch screen phone. Hopefully Apple hasn't patented this feature. As with my Galaxy Nexus, the auto screen brightness is too dim for standard use. Not sure how well it would prolong battery life for those who walk around a-lot while using their phones. Stylus is hard to remove—good that it won’t fall out on accident though. Surprisingly, it has not damaged any of my nails. Interestingly, my protection case makes removing the stylus very easy--You go Cimo S-Line Case In order to use USB 3.0, it has to switch to airplane mode--transfers don’t last very long at these speeds anyway and it has a built in feature to turn back on USB 2.0 mode if 5 minutes go by and USB 3.0 is not being used. This feature can also be problematic if you try to let Windows Convert a video file to be transferred to the phone which would take more than 5 minutes. Wall charger has USB port on the side of the wall unit which too me is an invite for bent prongs considering that it is recommended that you remove it to save power and it wastes a port on a lot of Surge suppressors.",3.0,14-02-2014,5.0,6075

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,matt,True,5,"Amazon Wireless and VZW. To preface the entire review, i was researching this device with VZW for over 2 months. Amazon has always had the lowest price, verizon couldn't even come close to matching it. The process was tedious for me because i was adding my line to a family plan and did not have the account holders driver license number and some other information. When trying to go through the process VZW customer service verified who I was and had the ability to make changes on the account but would not tell me the information I needed. Luckily the Amazon rep was on the phone with me and was able to help facilitate what I needed. While I was on the phone with VZW, at two separate points they tried to steal the sale from Amazon but could only offer discounts in accessories (which amazon was still beating their discounted pricing). After finally receiving my phone two days later, I tried activating my device. I spent over 4 hours on the phone with different VZW reps to help activate the device. No one could help me. I guess what happened was someone at verizon had my order set to be activated the following day, but they ported my number from sprint already. I was without service for almost 1 whole day. The following day was Thanksgiving when I needed to activate it, but VZW's support number was closed due to the holiday. Luckily i was able to connect with someone at Amazon who had a direct contact number, who was able to force my activation and get my phone up and running. If it wasnt for Amazon I would have been down an entire two plus days without a phone. After buying the device at $199.99 on Nov 26, I found the device price was lowered. I called amazon and since it was within 30 days of purchase they are refunding me the $50 difference. Which increased the monetary value for Amazon wireless even further! The only down side (besides hours on the phone trying to activate) was the fact that although I ordered the protection plan through VZW when ordering with Amazon, Verizon had no record of that. As long as it is within the first 30 days you can call VZW to add it. I had read a previous review that said that, which made me double check a week later after activation. All in All, i had a lot of hiccups with the process, but the Amazon wireless customer service made right by everything I went though and was a pleasure to work with and well deserving of my business. I will definitely go through amazon for my next mobile purchase.",3.0,15-12-2013,5.0,2469

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,AmesVon,True,5,"Absolutely Crushes the iPhone in every aspect. This phone is an amazing phone/tablet/toy/tool. It performs very well at each purpose that I bought it for. I have had it for about 3 months now and have never regretted it. The large screen is very clear and very vivid. Watching videos, editing photos and surfing the web are very easy with this screen. They camera is the best I have used on a mobile device and is the envy of my iPhone loving wife. The pictures are very clear and detailed. And it is very easy to use. I think it serves a very good purpose for replacing a tablet and smartphone with one device. The quality is great. If you are one of the Kool-Aid drinking Apple fans this can be the salvation to your addiction. iPhones are puny junk when compared to this thing. The removable storage is one of the many features that Apple refuses to allow in the iPhones and which I absolutely require in all of my devices. The only drawback is the lack of accessories. This, in my opinion, is a compliment to the fact that it is a tool and not a gadget to be used by self-obsessed, do-nothing hipsters living off mommy's money. It is a device for working, multitasking living people that want to enjoy their phone and not sit around waiting to waste their money on the next ""upgrade.""",2.0,23-04-2014,4.0,1288

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Daniel K.,True,2,"Amazing Phone But........ * Skip to bottom summary if you do not have time to read this* Let me start off by saying I am in love with this phone. I have owned it for 3 months now and can't seem to put it down. It is big enough where I do not have to squint to read emails such as on the iphone and small enough where I can text and type one-handed (I have bigger hands). The features that come packed with this phone are all very useful and great. There are honestly more features than anyone would need to use, but more is always better. It is very fast and doesn't seem to skip a beat with all my programs running in the background, as well as astounding battery life that lets me go without a charge for a minimum of 2 days. I have not had the mentioned reception issues so it may just be a bad batch of phones or the service in my area is very good. * Now, I bet you're wondering why I am only giving this product 2 stars when I have just talked so highly of this product. The poor rating is for amazon customer service and their bloatware. I had initially purchased the phone and chosen an address for it to be shipped to. An hour after purchasing I recognized a different address was designated for shipping. I contacted amazon an hour after the purchase (3 days before it shipped) and told them the correct address for shipping. I was told the problem was addressed but behold, my product was shipped to the other address and I did not receive my product in time or at the correct location, not to mention the product came a day late. * Once I received my phone I was willing to let the shipping mistake slide until I started looking through the programs and realized I could not delete any of the apps that amazon preloaded onto the device. Granted, they are not very high in memory usage but when I spend 200$ of my hard earned money on a good product I would like to have the option of choosing which apps I need and don't need. To put it in perspective it is like buying a car and not having the option of choosing which features you want and don't want. The only thing you can do is disable the apps so they dont run in the background, but they still take up memory that should be free. The phone does come with other preloaded apps (samsung & google) that cannot be removed but they are at least desirable and used every day. I actually considered returning this phone due to the unnecessary bloatware and inability of removal, but decided that the product is too good to let a couple apps ruin its integrity. A company should not jam their products down a customer's throat and expect positive feedback. Quite actually, it deters me from using your apps on any of my devices. SUMMARY: Phone is a great product, much better than the Iphone 4s I switched from. Amazon shipping disappointed me and sent phone to wrong address. Amazon pre-loads their permanent bloatware apps onto the phone (cannot be removed). My recommendation is to purchase this phone from your cellular carrier as it will come preloaded with less bloatware apps.",5.0,02-04-2014,7.0,3044

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,TL Hord,True,4,"Great phone, ridiculously great screen - but has keyboard annoyances that Motorola does not.. This phone is pure awesome. End of story. Lightning fast, full 1080p screen (which is mind-blowingly clear) - this phone has a lot going for it. However, Motorola has Samsung crushed when it comes to user-friendliness regarding typing. Let's face it - everyone gets annoyed now and again with auto-correct. But at least Motorola's auto-correct is intuitive, and understands when it changes ""Staind"" to ""Stained"" - and you go back to change it back to ""Staind"" because it's actually what you meant.... Motorola understands ""OK, you really meant to spell it that way... we'll let it go."" Samsung corrects you again. And even better, on a Motorola Droid - when you hit ""backspace"" after an auto-correct, it changes ""Stained"" back to ""Staind"" because it realizes you actually meant it that way. And, again on a Motorola, when you hit ""Sym"" to get your comma, then you hit comma, when you hit the spacebar to go to the next word - the keyboard changes back from symbols to letters for you. On Samsung, you have to hit ""Sym"" again to return to the qwerty keyboard. Minor things... I know.... but it's very surprising Samsung gets these things wrong. I'd think by now, they would've had time to realize these inconveniences in their keyboard programming, and fix them for us. Maybe someday....

The phone is fast, which is very important to me since my last phone had a very long and annoying lag time when I tried to make phone calls. Apps run quickly. The camera takes nice pictures. A couple of annoying things about it are: 1) The audio volume rockers are directly opposite the screen on/off button, which results in many unintentional presses that change the volume when trying to turn off the screen or turning off the screen when trying to adjust the volume. 2) There is no way to turn the sound on and off from the lock screen. Also, the rocker switch doesn't have any effect with the screen off or the lock screen on. To silence or un-silence the phone, it's necessary to unlock the phone and then use the volume rockers. 3) The video recording software freezes often.",10.0,12-12-2013,15.0,871

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,MC,True,3,"Not really what I thought it would be. I was hoping for so much more. I upgraded from the Galaxy Nexus to the Note 3 in hopes of having a more productive phone. The only reason to buy the Note 3 is the stylus and ability to write notes (otherwise it's no different than any phone except much bitter). While the device does a good job with transcribing my chicken scratch, I find it hard to write small enough to fit an email address or other notes. The biggest annoyance I have is that some of the features that made this phone device to desirable just aren't that good. Mainly the split screen apps. The system locks out most of the apps and only allows a small handful of apps to be use. You have no control over the apps. So if you want to watch Slingbox or HBO GO while texting or sending emails you cannot do it. Additionally, the buttons are a bit different than what I am use to. My favorite button was the window selector that allows you to switch apps. Doesn't exist on the Note 3. You have to hold the home button for a couple seconds. I find this very annoying. This device has a lot of promise but Samsung did a horrible job of allowing people to actually use the device. I wish I could have got the S4 or something else.

The device hardly functions as a phone even, and it overheats insanely (which also burns its own batteries so it doesn't last even half a day)-- frankly if I had energy I would have claimed an FTC complaint or something because I bought a device for a lot of money thinking that it would be a phone and also a capable mobile computing device and instead received a heavy brick that gets no reception and has no battery to make calls and tries to scorch my skin through the pant pocket...

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Barrett,True,5,"Could only be better if someone other than Samsung made it. I love the phone. It has worked superbly for me. I came from a much simpler phone, so getting used to all of the options was a bit challenging but very fun at the same time. There are two things I'd like to talk about with this phone: Size, and Samsung's Customer Service. Size: I can never go back to a smaller screen. I really don't care that sometimes it is tough to reach some of the letters when texting or that I almost drop it sometimes when I don't have a good grip on it. I love having so much screen real estate! I love it and I will never go back. In general though, I don't have much trouble texting on it or using it one handed even without enabling the special one handed use feature. I'm 6'2"" so I'm somewhat taller than average, so it may be that I'm just large enough for the size to be a good fit. Samsung's Customer Service: Terrible. I don't think they really get how it's supposed to be done. I don't think they really understand how to please customers the right way. That's probably why they have so many useless features all piled on the phone. Get rid of some of them and make others just plain work better! Anyway, it started with my phone arriving. I opened the box and got right into everything, then noticed that there wasn't an included headset. I just thought, ""Wow, are they really that cheap that they can't even include a headset(that probably costs them $1 to make) with their most expensive phone?"" So I contacted customer service to see if there was any way I could get one. I had sold my pair of Beats headphones since I don't listen to music as much anymore and had been thinking I'd use the stock headset that I thought would come with it. I basically got a flat ""no."" My next aggravation came when I saw a news article that said ""Free $50 Google Play credit for Note 3 Customers."" I quickly made my way to the link provided, only to be met with a screen that said ""Due to the high demand, we have run out of our supply of credits. Thank you for your interest!"" The promotion was supposed to run for 2 months and instead lasted less than 2 weeks. Really Samsung? I contacted customer service again to see if there was any way a disgruntled customer could get in on those free credits. Again, a flat ""no."" These are somewhat little things, but it's the little things that make good customer service, and I feel like Samsung fails miserably in that department.",1.0,17-12-2013,3.0,2458

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Amazon Customer,False,5,"Most amazing Cell Phone Ever.... I have always thought the Note was an interesting concept since the first version. I love my iPhone but with each release I became more and more disappointed that they never increase the screen size. I was worried about moving from my Apple iPhones, but it was time I had to try. I have been absolutely amazed by this phone. The size of the screen is terrific. The first few days it felt huge and took some getting used to, but by day 3, it was normal and no big deal. I look at my iPhone and think ""Wow, I settled for that tiny screen?"". I figured with this big screen I would have to run from outlet to outlet with a charger, but it lasts all day where my iPhone couldn't. The speed, the image quality, and the functionality of this phone is just amazing. The S-Pen features and Samsung's spin on the Android platform are perfect. The S-Pen allows for such accuracy on the screen that you can do very detailed work on a relatively small screen. It's integration with Evernote is great and the Sketchbook allows the average artist an excellent canvas in his or her pocket with Adobe illustrator like features. The keyboard has a top row of numbers making input of passwords and data so much faster. They not only improved the speed of a Smartphone, they improved the speed that a user and work with it, making my iPad and iPhone obsolete. I was able to transfer my music with little effort thanks to the Google Play music app including the things I purchased. I used the Note app to sync notes on my Apple devices. The integration between the Note 3 and Evernote offer a solution to this. The only negative I can say about the phone is S-Voice is no Siri. I used the location based reminders on the iPhone often for things such as ""Remind me when I get home to take out the trash"".. I have yet to get S-Voice to do this, but I understand it's supposed to be able to. I'm almost speechless at how perfect this phone is. If you are interested in a bigger screen are worried about leaving the iPhone, dont be. Give this phone a few days to get used to and you wont look back..",216.0,14-10-2013,246.0,2107

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,MUuu,True,1,"don't buy this wonderful phone here... I want to start by saying Note 3 is actually a wonderful phone. However, the one I got from Amazon with Verizon was not... I purchased the phone from amazon wireless with Verizon because they were having a really good deal for this phone.. However, it turned out to be a disaster. I first heard a static noise from time to time when I was on the phone.. And then, the fully charged battery died within 12 hours (on power saving mode).. I don't use my phone a lot usually, my iphone 4 can last me over 2 days.. So at first I thought switching to Samsung from Apple was a huge mistake. Then I searched online, everybody online says that the samsung note 3 is supposed to have a really good battery, actually pretty much the best in the market.. So with all these problems, I returned the phone to amazon, and went to a local AT&T store and bought the same phone. It turns out that the phone's battery IS really good. Now my note 3 also lasts me at least 2 days, without being on the power saving mode. I am not sure if all phones from Verizon are of such poor quality, or Amazon wireless has bad phones, or I'm just unlucky.. But at least Amazon's return service is good. So if you get a bad phone as I did, you can at least send it back...",6.0,27-01-2014,8.0,1277

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,manbearpig,False,5,"I'm loving it. This is my second Samsung phone (after galaxy nexus) and I can already say that I won't be moving away from Samsung phones in the near future. As an FYI - my smartphone usage history comprises of HTC Kaiser/AT&T Tilt, Blackberry 8700, iPhone 3G, HTC EVO 4G, HTC EVO 3D, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, LG Optimus G and now this Samsung Galaxy Note 3. You can probably find more than one million reviews for this phone online. Hence I'll not include any of that readily-available info in this review. Following is my feedback of the black galaxy note 3 (Verizon version). - NOT CDMA: Before getting this phone, I was under the impression that ALL Verizon phones are sim-less (CDMA) but I was wrong. All Verizon feature phones are CDMA. All Verizon smart phones use a sim card. Also, if you buy this phone online, chances are that the sim card will already be installed inside this device. So do not spend too much time looking inside the box, vacuuming your living room, yelling at your spouse, and then searching the parking lot. Look inside the device first! - GOOGLE VOICE DOES NOT WORK: This is not related to this phone as much as to Verizon. Verizon does not allow Google Voice. And hence if you are a current Google Voice user (to make international calls), make other plans. You will not be able to continue using Google Voice to make international calls once you get this phone. - SCREEN RESISTS FINGERPRINTS: While I could not find anything online that mentions that the screen is oleophobic, I very much suspect so. This screen resists fingerprints to a large extent. May be it was a requirement for the s-pen (stylus). May be not. Either way, I'm not complaining. - CALL QUALITY ROCKS: Both local as well as international calls are crystal clear. - SCREEN AUTO BRIGHTNESS WORKS: I have used smartphones before which had their auto-brightness feature set to either too aggressive or not aggressive enough. This phone gets it just right. I never have to worry about not being able to read it in sunlight or get blinded by the screen at 3AM. - HOME BUTTON IS NOT CLICKY ENOUGH: I mean it works but does not feel as clicky as the iPhone - ONE HANDED MODE: Features like these differentiate this phone from other phablets. I'm surprised at how much I use the one handed mode while driving or hauling groceries or sex and stuff. - TOUCHWIZ: Everyone knows that touchwiz is not the prettiest UI layer on android, but it does add features that do not exist natively in android. Rather than providing 16 weather widgets and 24 clock widgets, Samsung has focused more on including features like raising your phone to your ear to answer a call, one touch status bar, swipe right to call, swipe left to text, incoming call notification window (when screen is on), smart stay, hand gestures and stuff. - MY MAGAZINE: This feature does offer the promise of a good native RSS reader but the lack of customization (in adding your own feeds) makes this less useful as of now. I hope they make it more customizable in future updates. - BATTERY LASTS MORE THAN ENOUGH: With moderate usage, I have not had to charge my phone before bedtime so far. In fact, the lowest I managed to drive down the battery was ~25% on a day that involved shooting videos using 4K, smooth motion, slow motions and stuff. - HANDWRITING RECOGNITION WORKS: Every time you have the s-pen out, you get the option of writing instead of typing the text in most text fields. I would say that this works about 90% of the time. And it even identifies cursive! - DISABLE APPS: If you do not like pre-installed apps (from Verizon or Samsung) that you can not uninstall, this phone offers you the next best thing. You can simply disable any app in the settings and then you don't have to worry about those disabled apps running in the background or using your location data and stuff. - GOOD BUILD QUALITY: As a side note, I'd also like to mention that my almost-2-year-old galaxy nexus is still rocking even after getting abused at the hands of my 3 year old multiple times while my less-than-one-year-old LG Optimus G did not survive. I'm confident that this phone will be equally strong and durable. Also, in spite of being such a large device, it is surprisingly easy to hold. While my LG Optimus G was very slippery, this is more grippy. - PHOTOS AUTO-MOVE TO SD CARD: If you insert a micro SD card, the phone starts saving all the photos/videos to it automatically (and you can change this in settings if you like). This is a convenient and well-thought feature. I'm loving my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black (Verizon Wireless), hope this helps. UPDATE NOV 6, 2013: Google voice started to work on this phone. Not sure what changed, may be google updated their app in some way but Yay... Another strike in the pros column. UPDATE JAN 2, 2014: So I have had some more time with this phone and I explored its built-in RF transmitter (remote functionality) and it works fine. I'm probably in the minority here when I say that all my TV, cable box and sound bar are manufactured by Samsung but my Note 3 has no trouble controlling any one of them. Plus the Samsung ""WatchOn"" app is cool for browsing whats on TV currently across various channels and if you like something, just tap the ""Watch on TV"" button and voila! Also - I'm able to control my Samsung TV and cable box thru my Sony tablet. So I would assume that this phone should not have much trouble controlling non-Samsung branded devices.",67.0,23-10-2013,77.0,5459

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,FALCON,False,5,"Best cell phone on the planet!. [Forget those silly complaints about region lock. They do not affect 99.99% of users and no USA carriers. The N9000 is the European phone, and gets setup for the carrier used in the European country where you activate the phone. Period. US users need to get the phone for their respective carrier which changes the last digit of the number. It's that simple. Amazon makes both available. I teach overseas yearly. I keep my phone in airplane mode and use Wi-Fi or get a cheap phone card.] First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store. I am a writer though. Secondly, I hate long reviews with the poster just reports the specs you already have. Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today. As for those phones that only show an app screen. I call them cave phones. 1. The beautiful 5.7"" Super Amoled HD display has a ""Wow!"" factor. Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI. Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks. Check it out for yourself. For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast. Is this practical? You bet. You get more viewable data for all social networking apps; you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps; you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it. I will never go back to a small screen phone. This phone is a joy to use. 2. The CPU (For US versions) is the quad core Qualcomm snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time. It will perform well for years to come. A few other phones have it. No lag on this baby. Just try to do things to outpace it. It moves data faster than you can see. Partially because of #3. 3. The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it. Graphics are amazing. It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer. 4. It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM. It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage and you can add more with an SD card. Note: No extra charges for these! 5. It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED. Very few phones have this. It is also the only phone to do 4K video right now - sharp! It also does 1080P video at 60 FPS which is great. 6. No other phone has USB 3.0. 2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable. File transfer times are faster. With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC. With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds. 7. How many phones have an S Pen? Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional, and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate. 8. How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery? It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen. Hardware CPU and GPU improvements, as well as Android 4.3 make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant. You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones. 9. It does infrared remote control. It also has TV-out (via MHL A/V link), Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor. I'm serious people, you get more for your money. 10. Hello multitasking! The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone. You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen. This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor. The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer. How many phones can do that? You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever. 11. This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period. The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen. Don't believe me? Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself. 12. It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites. DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location. 13. Got Knox? No, you don't. This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi. You don't have to use it, but it is there. 14. The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic. How many phones do that? 15. Is the screen too large for one handed operation? Yes, but so what? The tradeoff is worth it. Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds. 16. I have been using the original Galaxy Note, which is actually wider, wearing suit pants to jeans. Both phones fit fine in your pocket. Don't worry about it unless you wear skinny jeans. 17. The TouchWiz UI is fine, and superfast now, but I prefer a 3rd party launcher - Go Launcher EX from the play store. Over a million users. So, the launcher is not a deciding factor in phone purchase for any Android manufacturer. There are a few things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion. I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient for users. The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong. I do like the new speaker placement though. Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user. However, there should be two of them or a better one. It is Ok, just not great like the rest of the phone. This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box. Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing. Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones. That means Samsung can do it too. Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof. It's doable, so please do it. Smoke it with that nano-whatever waterproofing stuff. You went to CES. All that said, I'm very happy, with the Note 3. IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer. As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now. There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in most cases does it better, for the same flag-ship- phone price. I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising hype who don't research the market. They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth. Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information. Thanks Amazon. Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too. Recommendation - get a case for any phone, one that raises a bevel on the front glass, and try to find a good screen protector.",209.0,15-10-2013,239.0,7531
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Mark Tidwell Jr.,True,2,"Maybe you can live with it, I couldn't.... I was excited to have this shiny new phablet, until I started to use it. I am new to Samsung, so I figured the UI would take a little getting used to. I was right; the interface is very different from Motorola or HTC. I think of myself as tech savvy, but the phone had little logic in the design of the menu's or locations for any of it's 80 important settings. The camera rocks at 13MP with crystal clear pictures, as long as you use the flash... The S-pen working on the ""back"" and ""list"" buttons was very nice but palming the pen to push the home button is tedious. The display is stunning and the ""adapt"" features on both the sound for headphones, and visuals are great. Speaking of sound, if you like listening to music or watching videos, I suggest you pick up a decent pair of headphones with your order. The speaker is terrible, its distorted and very sharp on c and s sounds. While loud, it lacks clarity in its volume. Additionally, the microphone is trash. I've had some one talk to me using my phone and the distortion is present here as well. If you talk on speaker a lot, as I do, this probably isn't for you. It, like every other phone I've purchased in the last 2 years, comes pre-installed with a ton of ""instant disable"" apps. (I would love to get the choice of what I want to store on my phone for a change.) It also functions poorly with the Youtube and Spotify apps I run. Aside from this, there is also the voice activation. It turned on at its choice of awkward moments, calling and texting without my knowledge. This, more than any other reason, lead me to the decision to send it back and choose a different phone. I'm going to miss the S-pen and Scrapbook but I think I can get over it. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 might be a great phone for some, but not for me. I wouldn't recommend it, but I won't say it was a bad phone. I like where they're going with this line but I'm going to stay away until they work out all those bugs... Good luck, and happy shopping :-)",13.0,30-11-2013,18.0,2032
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,RavenCorbie,False,5,"I love this phone!. I have had this phone for about one month now (I got it directly from Verizon, not through Amazon), and I just love it. It is my first Smartphone, and I will admit I was a little nervous going from a basic flip phone to ANY Smartphone, let alone one as large and robust as I heard this one was. My main reasons for choosing this phone over others were: 1. I really wanted a tablet, but I wanted one that would fit in my purse; if it would work as a phone, too -- great! 2. I'd done a lot of research on styluses, and most of them seemed kind of large for any type of writing (they seem to be about the size of a pencil eraser, and while there are some small pencil erasers on certain mechanical pens, I was looking for a finer point), so the S-Pen really intrigued me. I also liked the fact that it is stored inside the phone; when looking at others, I was worried I'd end up losing any stylus I bought that I couldn't attach to the phone in some way. I was absolutely right on both counts, ESPECIALLY the S-Pen. I honestly cannot imagine a smartphone without something like this. I use the S-Pen all the time. It's like having a small notepad in my hand when I want to do any writing (text messages, note-taking, etc.). I don't have to try to use my fingers on hovering keys: I can write everything by hand. Although occasionally, the phone doesn't get the word right, most of the time it does. There was no extended handwriting-training like what I remember from trying out speech recognition software, You can also get other languages activated for FREE. I tried the Russian out, and it was just wonderful to see it turn my admittedly poor handwriting into recognizable words. Also, because the S-Pen has such a fine point, it has excellent precision for tapping on apps and checking checkboxes, anything you might want to do on the phone. I often even use it to write out digits in my Tip Calculator app, rather than trying to use the number keypad that shows up on the screen. And although this isn't mentioned anywhere, the S-Pen has a very nice feel to it, though I suppose people with big hands might find it to be too skinny. I have tiny hands, and the phone as a whole is just perfect for me. It probably helps that I look at it more as a tiny tablet that can make calls and less as a phone; not having had a smaller smartphone before probably helps, too, especially since I did occasionally use my parents' iPad. Now, I'll admit, I belong to the paper generation. There are just some things I do better on paper than on a computer, and having the ability to write out my thoughts on the phone, rather than typing them, is wonderful for me, since it's a bridge between the two modes. There are a lot of other excellent things about this phone. Although I charge it at night when I go to bed, I usually don't have to. I only do it because I'm worried if I skip a night I'll just stop charging it altogether (the problem I've had with past phones: they were either off or out of charge 90% of the time because I'd forget to turn them back on or I wouldn't notice that it was out of charge). Usually I have at least 75% power left. Granted, I'm not on my phone constantly doing things, but I'm still very impressed with the battery life. I also find that taking pictures is very easy and for the most part, the pictures turn out well. That said, since I've never had another smartphone before, I can't really compare it to other smartphone cameras, although my pictures tend to come out better than my mom's (iPhone 4S). The only issue I had was that I didn't know what the power button was. Not having had a smartphone before and having parents who had an iPad, I thought the big button on the bottom on the phone (the one you can see in the picture) was the power button. So one night when I HAD forgotten to charge my phone for several nights, it simply turned off, but I couldn't figure out how to turn it back on. I had to watch a YouTube video to see that the power button is actually on the top side of the phone. I was starting to worry that the phone had actually died and I'd have to get it repaired or get a replacement or something. Thankfully, it was just user lack of knowledge! At the end of the day, though, it is the S-Pen that makes me love this phone as much as I do. I just can't even imagine a phone without one.",15.0,18-07-2014,20.0,4360

I have used the phone pretty heavily through a 12 hour shift and still had 40% left at the end of the day. Don't let the one star review fool you, any apps you do not want can simply be disabled and the magazine app that is brought up by double tapping the home button can simply be disabled by checking a few boxes (no registration necessary), going into the app settings and unchecking the option for the home button.

I'm very pleased that I can now use such a premium device without a contract. I must be spending only $100 or less a year with Tracfone to use this phone (minutes, data, and text are tripled when purchased). The phone itself is marvelous. After using Tracfone phones for so long (i.e. Dynamic II, Ultimate 2), the Note 3 is just a breath of fresh air. The screen quality is super clear, colors are vibrant, and it runs fast and smooth. The s-pen is a bonus! If you download the app called ""Screen Off Memo"" from the XDA forums, then you can write notes on your screen while it is turned off, just like the Galaxy Note 5 offers. No complaints here! This phone is a dream come true for Tracfone customers. Note: I didn't get this phone from Amazon; I bought it new from Ebay.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Michael D. Newcomer,False,5,"Never thought I would switch from iPhone - until Now. Even though I was heavily invested in the 'Apple Ecosystem' (iPad, iMac, iPhone, iPod, all that stuff), I just wanted a big screen! I had the iPhone 4S before, and waited patiently for Apple to come up with a bigger screen, and the iPhone 5 was a huge letdown. Yes, longer, but not wider. Texting on that tiny screen, even in landscape was slow, and I never liked the autocorrect on the iPhone. Just mad they wouldn't listen to their customers. Then I was at the Verizon store and saw the Note 3. The display is beautiful and crisp, and I love how you can customize this phone to your heart's delight. First thing I did was purchase Swiftkey and can almost text as fast as I type on a computer (100 wpm). A lot of the same apps that I had to pay for from the iTunes store are free on Google Play, and that was nice too. The Note 3 blows away the iphone on processing speed, so I can finally play graphic heavy games like Dead Trigger 2 without freezing or stuttering. Web pages load instantly, and with a screen this large, watching Youtube videos no longer has me switching to my iPad. My iPhone 4s was only 3G and going to 4G LTE was a real treat! Blazing fast! The iPhone had to be charged every day, without fail. I can easily get 2 full days of battery life out of the Note 3 with light usage, well over a day with heavy usage. Call quality is crisp and loud enough for me, although I see others who say it isn't. The stock ringtones that came with it were not loud enough, but Google Play has lots of free ones that are pretty good. The stylus is a really nice option, and I can tell Samsung really put time into designing it, but for my purposes it's just faster to do it by keyboard. Artistic folks will love it. Another thing that's nice that Apple doesn't allow, is access to the battery. I picked up the Samsung spare battery charging system so now I never have to plug my phone in to charge; just switch out batteries. The only drawback is it makes using a defender case a pain, so I just have a screen protector and nothing else. It's also nice to have a backup in case of power outages, etc. Holding the phone takes practice. It's much thinner and lighter than the iPhone 4s and a lot wider. I find myself touching the screen and selecting things by accident when picking it up. It looked so huge in the Verizon store, but after having it a few days, it looks like a normal phone, and everyone else's looks tiny. I know a lot of my fellow tech heads bash Touchwiz, but I have only ever used Apple, so I don't know what stock Android actually looks like. To me, it's pretty fluid. I like lots of blips and beeps, so it works for me. Not once has this phone stuttered or lagged. Seems like Verizon is slow getting Kit Kat out to us, but have heard others say that is pretty typical. I would recommend this phone to anyone. If you spend all day and night with your phone, you will not be disappointed by the Note 3 at all. C'mon Apple!!!",15.0,20-02-2014,20.0,3002
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Amazon Customer,False,5,"It came from outer space and changed my life. It came from outer space and changed my life. My old phone, an original Samsung Note, became non-functional because it was a replacement phone because I'd temporarily lost the original phone. Apparently, the replacement phones sent out by the insurance company are not always as reliable as originally purchased store items. Anyway- the Note 3. First, there's the HD Netflix with no buffering lag. If you're caught in a dead space somewhere, waiting for something, this feature alone is transformative. You're looking at high quality video, on a miniscule screen that is as crisp as anything you'll see anywhere. In your pocket, in your hand, anywhere you are. Popcorn quality. That's just for starters. Someone leaves you a voicemail. Guess what- you don't have to listen to it- it shows up as text on the screen. Hi, It's Bob, blah blah blah. Well, you didn't need to listen to that message, just erase it- without having to actually listen to the blah blah blah. Very satisfying and time saving. The camera resolution is crisp. The speed is fantastic. The phone feels good in your hand- the faux leather backing is a winner. It's light. Sturdy. Fast. I use the maps function for work. Often, the app spits out a location in five to ten seconds, which is exactly how quickly I need to get it. Plus you get the tune-in radio app, which gives you the actual broadcast from any radio station around the world. So, you're sitting in your home town and listening to some dude in Nairobi, Kenya talking about the latest hit single from some guy or girl you've never heard of. In real time. From Kenya. In Africa. Or, you can listen to the Great Courses from the Teaching Company- their app for Android is Absolutely Fantastic. And of course, it works, as a phone. How cool is that?",1.0,31-10-2014,3.0,1823
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,David Lee,False,5,"Best phone I ever had.. This phone is amazing. I previously had Galaxy Nexus before I had it stolen and been using the old Galaxy 1 and I hated that phone because it had such a horrible battery life and weird features. Well this Note 3 is simply amazing. Over 10 hours on battery with playing movies clips for good 8 hours and it still has enough juice to last another half a day. Great accuracies with its stylus pen and has great features like taking notes on the captured current screen with a push of a button. Really its a life style changer. Comes equipped with so many useful apps like professional version of Sketchbook, workout mate that can track the numbers of steps you take and monitor your heart rate (although having your phone against your chest to have it measured doesn't seem like a too good of an idea), and so much more. It's versatility beats iPhones or ipads anyday. I own an Ipad but this phone feels 10 times more easy to use because they offer open source for app developers you're not limited to just certain apps.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,IT_Architect,False,4,"Great Phone, but has some limitations. Our company has used Windows Mobile phones in the past. Windows Mobile is no more, and the current phones they call Windows Phones don't even have a hint of Windows in them, and is a merging of a game console and a phone. Thus we needed to pick either IOS or Android. We are an IT company, so our requirements may be different than yours. ***************************************** What I like: ***************************************** 1. Android now has well functioning apps for RDP, SFTP terminals, and SFTP file managers to allow us to manage servers remotely. 2. The large HD screen allows you to use it like a tablet or laptop. 3. As with Windows Mobile, we now have a stylus, handwriting to text, and voice to text. 4. The battery life is not much different than our old phones, and if anything , better. 5. It has a replaceable battery. 6. It comes with a lot of internal storage, and great potential for SIM storage. ***************************************** What I don't like: ***************************************** Basic, missing, functionality. 1. There is no way to record phone calls through Bluetooth. It works fine from the phone itself, but often people will be on the road, and not be able to take notes, or maybe need to forward the conversation to another employee to get them in the loop, and I don't mean storing on someone else's server either, which is also illegal, and a violation of privacy policy. 2. There is no way for someone to backup their phone to their PC, and backing up on-line to someone else's server is illegal in many businesses, and a violation of privacy policy. We are used to being able to backup to a server, and restore the entire phone and settings if something bad happens from an app or other disaster. 3. Persistent Calendar alarms like there is with texts. That is crazy. If you have your phone on your desk and leave the room for a second, you miss it. 4. Fears of losing required functionality due to an OTA update, as has happened in the past. *NOTE: We are considering rooting these phones to obtain this basic functionality. Problems that might be specific to the phone or service: 1. The conversation usually has static on my end, not the customer end. This is a common issue that I see mentioned in reviews, while other rave about its clarity. Annoyances: 1. It's OK to get paid for including bloatware on the phone, but just don't bake it into the ROM. This is another reason why people want to root your phones. I just pile them into a folder named zGarbage. Many of these programs have user agreements that are illegal and in violation of companies' privacy policies. 2. My, and everyone else's, most hated object is My Magazine/Flipboard. It is always in the way, and to get it out of the way, you must agree to terms that are illegal for many businesses. So the miserable thing is always popping up when people don't want it. It is one great motivator for rooting and a custom ROM. 3. The Touchwiz launcher. I may be in a minority, but I like as much as any of the others except... a. You cannot control the number of rows on screen, and the default is rows spread far apart. b. You cannot back up your settings without rooting. This, you lose all of your settings if you have to do a factory reset. Thus, you must use something like NovaLauncher. 4. Needs a gadget for Wi-Fi to click and pick the network instead of navigating to settings because it is required so frequently, another thing I miss from 2009 Windows Mobile. 5. The default apps are scattered all over the place. They need to be in one place, in settings. It's nice to pop up the box every time you select a default, but you won't remember what it said a week later when you want to undo your default. Wishlist: 1. Lifeproof to make a case for it. For people who have used Lifeproof, and played other cases that claim to have similar functionality, it is a bigger deal than it appears to others.",0.0,30-10-2014,2.0,3967
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Jacque Strapp,False,4,"Great Phone... but three flaws. I really like this phone due to its screen size and fast processor. But after using it for three weeks, I noticed three problems... 1. Camera shutter sound: No way to turn the camera shutter sound off when snapping pics quietly, unless you turn off the volume of your phone. If anyone has any info on how to do this without turning off the volume on the phone, I'm all ears. 2. Air swiping and hand gestures for this phone may be ahead of the pack with current smartphones on the market, but it's still buggy and unreliable. By the time you swipe your hand across your phone three to four times for it to work, you could have pressed the home key to turn your phone on. Sometimes it works, most of the time it takes a few tries. 3. ""S Voice"" really stinks. Siri has it all over the galaxy on this one. I asked ""Galaxy"" about bowling alleys in my area five times and got a few different answers. Four answers unhelpful, while the fifth gave me a list of local bowling alleys in my area. But more so, S Voice is buggy as well. When it fails to give me an answer to my question, it offers to check the web for me... but it doesn't. When I click on the link to check the web, the S Voice program closes out. Otherwise, this phone is truly top notch.",2.0,19-03-2014,4.0,1277

I traded in my iPhone 4s, used a Costco sale and various discounts and got it almost for free! Pros: Faster than the iPhone (much, much faster). More memory (expandable) than the iPhone (I have 64 GB total with a memory card) Large screen (I can actually read my emails and Kindle books on it!) Like the pen feature, although I often forget about it because I've never had one before Cons: My iPhone had near perfect reception in my home state as well as when traveling. The Note 3 can be static-y in the same areas. Lots of bloatware than drain your battery. You have to stay on top of it and disable things on a regular basis. Not as intuitive as iPhone. There is a learning curve, but if you are willing to learn, you can customize your phone. Also, I have mostly Apple products at home, including our Mac, which is our main computer. Getting the Note 3 to ""talk"" to the Mac took some fiddling but now it's pretty good. If you are not willing to learn to use this phone to it's maximum potential, get an Apple product.

There is only room for 1 card so go with highest you think you will need. **Tip - dim down the brightness a little. I took it down by about 25% to preserve battery life. I threw out my old camera because it was 10 mega pixels and this phone is 13!! The pictures this phone takes are second to none. It runs android OS which is powered by Google and Google Play. I am a google person so I am great with this feature. I use the phone GPS quite a bit when driving and it eats away at battery life. **Another trick is to hold down middle button and choose “Close ALL” which closes all apps running to preserve life.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,J. Paul,False,5,"Exceeding my high expectations. There are so many features I love about this phone, I am not sure where to start. For over a year I read reviews of other phones and held off buying because I felt all phones sacrifice in some areas including key things like camera, battery life, removable memory, processor speed, quality, etc. When I saw the specs and read the many positive reviews I was glad to see this phone made no sacrifices; however, I wasn't sold until I handled it in a retail store and was amazed by the screen image quality, speed and more importantly the very thin and light feel of the phone not only for a screen this size, but for screen of any size. Some reviews complain about quality; however, I have to disagree; I have been using this phone for 3 months without a case and it looks and feels great even after several drops. I don't baby this phone and it is holding up great without a scratch. The camera takes amazing photos and videos indoors, many times without using flash. I have received numerous complements from others, especially when I project onto my 64 inch plasma TV where most phone camera flaws are exposed. The video quality is so good, I find myself watching sports and movies on this phone and letting family have the 64 inch plasma, but I really don't feel like I'm making a sacrifice watching this beautiful screen in my hands vs the 64 inch Samsung plasma on my wall - its that good!! I am not a heavy stylus user; however, it comes in handy in areas I wouldn't have guessed. I like using it to capture screen images and send to friends with hand scribed notes. Also in those moments I find myself needing pen and paper to write quick notes, I prefer to use stylus over typing notes. S Educate is an amazing learning tool that has creative use of stylus for fun learning at all ages. The speed is also amazing! I rarely see the waiting spinning symbol, all apps are there almost instantly. The battery life typically lasts two days with about 30-60 minutes of internet music a day along with 45 minutes of navigation, 30-60 minutes of videos and more each day. I have never been more enthused for a product and anxious to share my experience. I know of 10-15 people that tried my phone and subsequently went out to buy one.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Chris Schink,False,5,"Swiss Army Knife of Electronics. I always thought that I was keeping my Apple IPhone 4S in great condition, and keeping the screen unbroken. IPhone, especially ones of an older generation are notorious for being susceptible to cracked screens. So there I was, sitting outside on my lunch break at work, with my phone sitting on the bench playing music. Buzz, there goes my phone vibrating off the bench. I was so scared to pick up my phone, but I had to see if it was broken. So I finally gathered the courage to pick up my phone and as I expected, it was shattered. I picked up my phone and called my mother to ‘break’ the news to her about my phone. Only to be relieved saying that she got a call from Verizon Wireless, saying that we could get new phones. So I decided to go look at new phones at Verizon and I came across something extraordinary. A phone, a laptop, or a tablet? Why pick one, when you can have all three with the Samsung Galaxy Note III? The Note III is a Swiss Army Knife of all electronics. The sleek, not-plastic back of the phone makes using the phone feel so different from other phones and tablets, because it's leather and has a unique texture. The unique texture has you constantly looking at your phone with all the fun and exciting design features. The stunning 5.7 inch screen is very invigorating. The screen is so vivid, it feels like you're looking into real life, rather than a virtual world. Being that the screen is so much larger than other newly released phones, the Samsung Galaxy Note III is the perfect size. For me, being six foot four inches, the larger phone fits better in my hands than the other phones that are available. Let's get technical. The software of the Note III is an android platform, with the JellyBean software. With the easy-to-navigate operating system, this phone allows you to do a countless number of things. Although the phone is all touch screen, the Galaxy S pen makes navigating through the phone very easy. The S pen is a very nice feature, because it allows you to accurately text and type things. Somebody like myself with sweaty hands would be very grateful to have an S pen to keep their screen clean, rather than covered in oils. Also, the phone will not let you forget the S pen anywhere! You can set it to give you a notification saying that you left your S pen somewhere. It's such a great feature for forgetful people like myself! For such a large phone, the battery life of this phone is excellent. Being that I’m on my phone ninety percent of the time, it lasts from six in the morning until 10:30 at night, without charging it anywhere in between. It's very convenient for a college student, especially when I’m always in the library studying.",2.0,31-10-2014,4.0,2727

Beware, aux sound or bluetooth playback for music is poor.. It's a near perfect phone. Beautiful screen, long lasting battery life, and tech specs are top notch. Camera is good enough for my use.

I cannot say more about the stylus. I love it. I actually don't mind reading or watching movies on this phone. Lastly, a big gripe, it seems like the DAC sound processor on it, whether if it's through AUX or Bluetooth needs improvement. It's not the best, and for my phone it's very low noise.

That said I've seen the worst and t he best. I chose the Note 3 because of the screen size and sacrificed a few things in doing so. First of all Samsung's manipulation of the android OS is cumbersome and a bit annoying all of the extra garbage and bloatware is a constant nuisance always asking for multiple log ins and sign ups. The recently added security is a major pain and kills apps that don't need to be. My biggest gripe with the Galaxy line is how cheap they feel, the Note 3 of course being the least of the bunch but still too much plastic. Another issue I have with all Samsung devices is the audio processor, this is easily fixed by adding an EQ like Power Amp but even with this add on fails to come close to an HTC one w/beats proc or an iPhone. Samsung has accomplished a major feat going against its main rival Apple but needs to keep a close eye on HTC with aluminum body design and LG making major strides with devices likeke the Flex and G2. I have already seen what the S5 is going to bring and I am by no means impressed so hopefully they make the 4 a much better design both internally and aestheticly. But as for the Note 3, I like the camera ( too much bloatware though) The screen size and clarity, the pen is useless, but the software is the one thing that will keep me from buying another Samsung.",4.0,31-03-2014,6.0,1413

Well I think that android is definitely at that point now and it is a rock solid and great operating system for phones and tablets. On the other hand I had mixed reviews about the hardware used on prior android phones. The specs always seemed impressive on paper but in real life usage I was not happy with the performance of android phones when compared to my iPhone experience. Something about them just didn't seem right. That is until I got my hands on a Galaxy Note 3. This phone is simply amazing. It has a rock solid operating system plus hardware that is blazing fast at everything! Plus the screen is awesome and the battery life is great. The S-Pen has a lot of neat functionality and is not just some gimmicky gadget it is actually useful and nice to have. I can finally say that I don't see anything that the iPhone has that this phone does not and on the contrary I feel that I couldn't go back to an iPhone because this phone offers things that the iPhone cannot such as the beautiful large screen and the S-pen.

But with Samsung Galaxy Note III, I can easy to download it and of course it’s free. Samsung Galaxy Note III is a good product with a lot of useful apps, and Samsung’s camera is better than Iphone 5. Because the quality of Samsung’s camera is higher than Iphone, you can even see small details in picture while Iphone 5 can’t.",2.0,21-02-2014,4.0,911
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,techreviewrpro,False,4,"Best available current phablet!. The Galaxy Note 3 is perfect for someone who wants a smartphone and a tablet, but doesn't want to splurge on both, let me start by saying the design of the Note 3 is highly improved over the Note 2, the screen is now .2 inches bigger and full 1080 p, also the display is much brighter, the new faux leather back is awesome, I see some reviews knocking it but I'm not sure why, it's gives it a grippy yet premium feel while still giving you access to the battery and sd card, while I love all aluminum smartphones, I don't like that you can't open them up to change out the battery, this phone is jam packed with many features, some of which don't work well and feel gimmicky such as smart stay, and smart scroll, it takes a while to go through the settings to configure it to your liking, this phone is certainly not for everyone, it's large size makes pocketability tough. The stylus feature is cool, for me it comes in handy when I'm out and about and suddenly need to jot something down. This phone is seriously fast for web browsing, and the multi window feature definitely comes in handy, for instance when comparing prices on products from different websites side by side. The camera is just ok, with the right lighting pictures look great, I'm disappointed in the lack of optical image stabilization, overall there is no better phablet on the market. Pros- 1080p, stylus, great battery life, fast processor, screen size. Cons- Camera needs some improving, size not for everyone.",4.0,21-03-2014,6.0,1518

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Lou,False,5,"THE BEST PHONE EVER!. The title is exactly how I feel. The Note 3 is an amazing phone/tablet (or ""phablet""). I purchased it a couple of days ago to replace my Motorola Razr Maxx which I loved until it recently started to freeze and lag. I had been eying the Note 2 for some time and wanted to wait for the price to drop. I'm glad I did not rush to buy it, because now the Note 3 is out and I found it half price and brand new at BB. I have the original Galaxy Note 10.1, which I love and use consistently for work. Of course, I would love to upgrade to the 2014 edition, but first the phone, and then.... So far, I find the phone to be easy to use, blazingly fast, crystal clear display, and the S-Note app is wonderful, which tempts me to no end to lunge for the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, lol. Upon purchase, I transferred the SD card from the Razr Maxx to the Note, which brought up all my saved pictures that I had downloaded, so no need to start over. I also immediately bought the Otter Box Defender to protect this phone, as it is a worthwhile investment. The phone is quite big, but this is what I like and my hands are large enough to hold the phone comfortably. Smaller hands may find it to be a problem. The phone sounds crystal clear, the audio (using headphones) is beautiful, and I will now begin to download some of my favorite apps to expand on the enjoyment of this phone. System updates were available immediately upon turning the phone on, and the updates downloaded with no problem at all. I find the plastic screen protector with Otter Box to be quite smooth, and does not interfere with the hand or S-Pen at all. And I feel good knowing the screen (and the whole phone) is well protected. I would advise a good strong case such as Otter Box, as this phone could easily slip out of your hands, mainly because of its size, but also because it is a bit slippery. Overall I have no complaints at all, but will update this review if anything else catches my attention. Should you decide to get this phone, you will not be disappointed.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,John,False,4,"I like compare to other android phone.. It's been almost a month with this phone, I like it I enjoy it more than I thought I would. I was formerly an iPhone 5 user, loved apple Eco system. Bah bah bah... First impression, wow it's big I wanted a big phone since I'm use to having small phone because of Apple. Maybe sometimes too big, sometimes I fell like its a perfect size. So first let's start with android, I had android phone in the past, I keep it for a week hate it promise myself to never buy another one.. It was different with this phone I got to say to running android 4.3 it was a different experience, android has changed a lot it's up to par with iOS, same issues same headaches. Like with any OS it has it kinks you just have to figure it out. Android is good now. There is a lot of apps out there that allows you to still share calendar with iOS and vice and versa. Love that. Hardware, specs are to blow you of water. I love the camera amazing photo quality very much what I was use to on iPhone 5. I love the display, it's just amazing. Bottoms too me a bit to get use to them, now I don't see anything wrong with them. Plastic is okay I wish that it was more durable I have a case since day one and I got a dent already. Battery, I can get a whole day without charging and heavy usage, two days if I use it modern and turn off all of the gps and sync. Battery is mainly use to power the beautiful display. Did I mention how beautiful it is. Samsung, not too happy I didn't buy this phone for brand I bought It for its size and specs. Samsung takes a lot from android, you can't use a headphones with remote without being a samsung compatible, you can have certain settings without downloading apps. It kinds blows. It's one of the reasons for my overall rating, I can't get too specific. Verizon, great... I have lots of unwanted apps to disable, junkware alert. No headphones included what a disappointment. I can clearly say I enjoy this phone more than I though I would. I really thought that I would return it.. But wanted to try something different. I got that with this phone, will I ever switch probably. For now this phone is enjoyable, I would recommend it.",6.0,07-11-2013,8.0,2186

It's light and compact (thin anyways).

I haven't experienced any lag issues but I worry about that as I add apps. I may want super user access on this phone to prevent some services from booting and using memory. usb 3.0 cable is cool and charges fast but not really economical to carry it around and the OEM Samsung cord sucks because it's to long and huge in a bag Ok I think that sums it up. If I find other flaws or gripes and I will update the review. Great job Samsung not, lets work on quality of materials and fit and finish.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Travis F.,False,5,"A Phablet Definitely Worth Considering. My first week of testing the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (Verizon) has yielded amazing results. I put on the 0.4mm tempered glass screen protector and was ready to give it a run through a myriad of tests before I decide to swap my current Galaxy S4 (GS4) for the Galaxy Note 3 (GN3). - Size: After coming from the GS4, the increased size of the GN3 is not that drastic. Perhaps 1mm thicker, 1/2"" longer, 1/4"" wider, but somehow this yields a 5.7"" screen over the GS4's 5"" screen. It just means you won't have to squint as hard to watch the boobies! - Weight: I am impressed by how light the GN3 is when compared to the GS4 and the GN2. There is a very slight difference of weight between the GN3 and GS4, but it's so minimal, that it certainly launches the GN3 to a new level. - Pen: The pen function on the GN3 is freaking phenomenal! However, I believe this is solely an OS issue, and not related to hardware. I found that the Papyrus app to be more to my liking than the included apps. - Speed: Oh my freaking chupacabra this sucker is fast, noticeably so over the GS4. Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor clocked at 2.27 GHz, holy moly, this puts the GS4's specs (quad-core processor clocked at 1.9 GHz) to shame. - Memory: 3 GB of memory vs the 2 GB in the GS4. - Storage: Glad to see Samsung boosted the stock storage from 16 GB as found in the GN2 and GS4, to a whopping 32 GB. I won't actually need an extra SD card now. - Battery: 25 hours of talk time unmodded/unrooted, are you serious? Wowzers, this 3200 mAh battery is the bomb, boasting a 22-day standby time. GS4 has a 2600 mAh battery, and gets around 20%-40% less talk/standby time. 84 hours of music playback anyone? Yes please. After 4 days and 2 hours, my battery is finally at 49% with wifi on. - Camera: Same as what's on the GS4, which is awesome! - Video: 4K video, wait what?! Are you kidding me? And up to 120 fps slow-motion capture??? Oh, this is going to be fun! 3840x2160 (4K) @30 fps, 1920x1080 (1080p HD) @60 fps, 1280x720 (720p HD) @120 fps. For reference, the GS4 only does 1080p HD at 30 fps. No wonder it took the #2 spot for top camera function on a phone! The only reason it didn't is somehow, that s***ty Windows Nokia phone scored half a point higher in camera function. In addition to the image stabilizer featured in the GS4, the GN3 also includes continuous auto focus. This is a HUGE improvement over the GS4's video capabilities. I took several videos with the GS4, and it was constantly loosing focus. Not anymore with the GN3! - Google Wallet: It's back! I think it's great that Google Wallet once again works on the GN3. I used to use it all the time on my developer version of the Galaxy Nexus. Google discontinued official support for this app on the GS4 for whatever reason, though a modded version could be applied. - Knox: An eFuse, that defaults to 0x0. Any attempts (currently) to modify the bootloader results in tripping Knox, or setting the eFuse to 0x1. Does this have any effect on the phone itself? No. It only means that once tripped, your warranty is void (as with rooting or adding a custom bootloader as it always has been) only now, Samsung has a way to track this. - Rooting: Full root and 0x0 Knox bypass has been established for the GN3. I believe the XDA community is currently working on a way to add a custom bootloader without tripping Knox. This is definitely a great device to consider if you are looking to go with a phablet!",16.0,23-10-2013,21.0,3484

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Matt,True,5,"Fantastic phone for those who want to be productive. I bought the first couple of iPhones when they first came out and use my wife's every now and then and I've also owned 4 or 5 different android devices and the note series is by far my favorite. I purchased a Note 2 when it first came out and loved it so I decided to go with the note 3 and it is an even better version of an already great phone. I was debating between this, the S5, and the HTC One M8 but I went with the note and took the ""hit"" in processing power for and extra Gb of ram (which is amazing). I've already rooted and installed the hyper drive rom but even without the extras of a custom rom this phone has so many features that make it a fantastic productivity tool. The S Pen alone is something that I use literally every day at work to take meeting notes. I work with meeting software that allows you to share your screen so I can do that while also taking nones on my Note 3 without showing everyone what I'm writing down. Then I sync with evernote and have all of my notes in the cloud, it's perfect. Fantastic phone with a great price here on amazon, couldn't be happier.",5.0,29-04-2014,7.0,1147
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Jon,True,5,"New Fan of Samsung because of the Note 3. This review is for the Note 3 in general, but also as a recommendation for LaptopAngels if that happens to be the seller somebody might be looking at. I gave LaptopAngels a 5-star review for sales and shipping, as well as for handling a return with courteous professionalism. The phone: The phone, the phone, the phone. I take back every bad thing I've ever said about Samsung. The 2-year-old Note 3 stacks right up there with every 2015 phone I've had my hands on. My daily driver is a Droid Turbo, and this Note 3 is every bit as much fun to ""drive"" as my Turbo is. I should qualify by saying that the Note 3 we eventually bought is still running Kitkat 4.4.2 (So I can't speak for this phone with Lollipop 5.x installed) and we plan to keep it on Kitkat... one BIG reason we were in the market for an older phone was an increasingly *severe* dislike for Lollipop. Basically, this phone replaces a new LG G4 with 5.1 (which replaced a G3 with 5.0) and the new owner could not be any happier. She had a Galaxy Note II before, and it croaked, which was the only reason she needed another phone. It was my mistake to steer her toward LG; should've considered the Note 3 in the first place. Samsung definitely got it right with this one.",4.0,09-08-2015,6.0,1277
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Jim,True,5,Awesome phone. best on market.. Best phone. Things you should know. 1. Best battery life than any other Android phone I have had. 2. Most features that are exclusive for this phone I thought I would use. I do not. For example I do not use the stylus as much as I did. The recent update killed the ease of use and coverting text from handwriting to text. So I do not use it anymore. 3. Fast response. Have had this phone for about 9 months. Still just as fast responding to touch and opening apps as day one. 4. Can only be used with a max mini SD card of 64gb. This is a minor complaint only. 5. Does not get hot. Unless you are doing a lot of stuff while charging this device does not get hot to the touch. The normal running temp is about 100 degrees Fahrenheit but you can not feel it. 6. Charges fast from dead to full charge. This is based on stock charger that comes with phone which pushes 2.1 amps. I also use a 3.5 amp car charger which it charges faster with. 7. The IR ability I use a lot for controlling my TV and dvr. The app the phone comes with is the best app but the app does need improvement though this is not the phones fault. 8. WiFi is fast. My Internet speed tops at 40mb/s and the phone WiFi can do it. Unlike most phones WiFi usually cap at 20mb/s no matter what. 9. I have the Verizon 4G lte and the lte I have seen push 60mb/s for speeds so again the phone ability for strong and fast signal is impressive. A bunch of other things positive and negative. I am disappointed in Samsung and their lack more rather restrictions of app abilities but this is not the phone fault. Great phone and best I have had.,2.0,03-10-2014,4.0,1632

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,James,True,5,"Used Note 3 to replace broken Droid Bionic... Wow!! What a phone!! I had long ago decided to replace my aging Droid Bionic with a Samsung Galaxy S4, but a phone Guru friend recommended that I consider the Note 3 instead of a Galaxy S4 as a replacement for my old, tired and broken Droid Bionic. After reading several reviews comparing the Note 3 with the Galaxy S4, and speaking with a local cell phone expert, I decided to spend $385 on a Note 3 instead of $250 for a Galaxy S4. When I placed the Amazon order for the Note 3, I wondered if $385, versus $250 for a Galaxy S4, was well spent. Well, after spending several hours learning how to use my ""loaded with features Note 3"", I am happy that I spent the additional $135. Compared to my Bionic (not a fair comparison I know) the Note 3 is Screaming Fast, and has lots of features that I hope to master in a month or two. If a potential user checks-out any of the dozen or so YouTube videos re the outstanding features of the Note 3 (Snapdragon Quad 800, great GPU, 3MB RAM, Stylus and on and on) and you might consider the Note 3 (or Note 4 if price is no consequence) as your next smart phone. I found several reviews comparing the Note 3 to the Note 4 that recommend the user stay with their Note 3 unless upgrading to a Note 4 is virtually free. One reviewer indicated that by late 2015 a successor to the Note 4 will be available with many improvements (though I can't imagine what can be done to improve the Note Platform).

We had a Verizon upgrade coming to us, so I was looking for a all-in-one device for my husband. He just wanted a phone and tablet. I saw a friend with this Note 3 and knew he would love it! He checked it out in the store and excited about everything but the price! Just as we got our upgrade the Note 3 went to $1! I grabbed it! He loves it! The screen is big enough for reading, the phablet is small enough to Palm! He only has 1 device to keep track of! He doesn't want a tablet at all now! The Note 3 runs on the same Android 4.4 as Note 4 and if you sign in with Samsung they upgrade you to 5.0! Between the Note 3 and 4 there really isn't a lot of difference, so we went for price. I was going to get one too but the price went back to $100. I was concerned about the size, Note has a 5.7 screen, for me to hold on to with the kids in my arms. I got the Galaxy s5, with a 5.1 screen, it's only a little smaller and fits my life better! Samsung also upgraded s5 to 5.0! The pro and con on Note 3 is the size, 5.7 ins.

So while doing my research and asking around, I came to discover that this phone is capable of having the battery changed. Well, that was a great selling point since my previous phone was only lasting half a day without needing to be recharged. Unfortunately, many phones today cannot have their batteries replaced when they are getting older,that is why the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was so appealing to me.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Nicole,True,5,"So far so good!. So far I LOVE it! Just got it a few days ago, but already easily adjusted to the screen size (which was my biggest concern). It's really only a little bigger than my old phone -- Droid Razr. They have a function that makes it easier to use with one hand if you like, but I find I can still reach around and do most things with a little stretch (I have small/average hands). The stylus is really AWESOME, especially that I can take notes in lecture and not have to worry about my hand making marks on the screen when I rest it (which was a huge problem with my ipad). With the stylus and the S note app (comes pre-installed), I can write in it as clear and naturally as in a paper notebook (huge bonus when it comes to storing notes, and wishing I had them to refer back to years later but didn't want to store those notebooks forever). No gripes yet, but I'm pretty vocal. If I come up with one, I'll post it! Oh, and HUGE tip from the verizon lady -- the old chargers WORK! The plug is totally different, and supposedly the included charger will charge it faster, but the older plugs actually fit and charge the phone! So happy I don't have to get all new accessories (car charger and more wall chargers for work and home).

However I've had problems with it on many google services such as Hangouts and Youtube sharing, many games and apps aren't supported on Android, the battery is quickly used up and it takes a couple hours to charge from zero to 100%. I've hardly used the pen, but I love the design for holding the pen inside the phone body, it is secure and never loosens so far. I don't like the design of having the off button opposite the volume button as it took forever to learn how to push one without pushing them both. Holding the phone on the bottom is awkward because of the menu buttons so it took some time to find a way to hold it.

I was replacing an LG G2 that I had, after many drops, finally killed and had no insurance on. I liked the G2, but I have to say, I love the Note 3. If I could have afforded the Note 4, I would have gone with that, but for my needs and budget, you really can't beat the Note 3. I love the size, which is so much easier on my eyes. I draw, so I do find the s pen really useful for doodling on the phone. I don't do any heavy gaming, so I've had no issues with lagging or memory. It does have bloatware that Samsung should really let you delete, but other than that, this phone knocks it out of the park, especially for a phone that isn't on the bleeding edge any more.

Most would say these are not fair comparisons because they are not in the same tier. But for me, the One Max was very enticing. I loved the idea of the front facing speakers, slightly larger screen, and better build. But what sold me was: replaceable battery, better GPU in the Snapdragon 800, and amazing AMOLED screen. I'm partial to the screen due to the deep blacks and infinite contrast. What has surprised me about the phone is the new quick charge 2.0 feature in the SD800.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Critical Reviewer,False,5,"I really was reluctant to purchase a Samsung device but then all that changed. All right here is an honest review about the note 3. It's something that I will approach from the perspective of someone in the Medical field, who needs to get things done quickly, and efficiently. First of all, I received my phone on October 10th, and I had pre-ordered it but DID NOT pay 299. Well initially I did, but there is a promo code of VERIZON30 that drops the note 3 down to 209.99. I bought the Note 3 for myself and the LG G2 for my wife. Needless to say, at the price of 139.99 for the G2 and 209.99 for the Note 3, we returned the G2 for the note 3 despite the G2's incredible low light camera performance. Here is why. Backstory: prior to buying the note 3 I have had the Droid Razr Maxx, which for its time was a great device. Now that apps are becoming more memory intensive, something needed to change. I needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me, and I really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down, or pausing a video if I look away. Who really cares about that stuff? If I want to pause, I tap on the screen, which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video. In addition, I really don't want that front facing camera on unless I am using it. Also, I was always reluctant to buy a Samsung phone because of the plastic build, but you know I always keep my phone in a safe case. I will talk about this a little later. Now, right before I let go of my razr maxx, I briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days. I chose the note 2 because I was in best buy and was comparing the HTC ONE which best buy had on sale for $50 and all of a sudden I decided to listen to the note 2's speaker. I was blown away in comparison to the razr maxx, but blown away which how much more I got in comparison to the HTC one. We are all going to large screens now, and frankly who the heck wants to hold the phone closer to their face? I certainly don't so I upgraded to the note 2. I really did not fall in love with it until the day I was sitting in my senior human cadaver anatomy course, and realized I had forgotten my Anatomy atlas and my notebook. I frantically searched the note 2 and found an app called S Note. I opened S note and began using it. I was blow away, there are blood vessels that are large and really thing, and I used to be able to only differentiate that on paper. Not this time, with the note 2 I was able to use the thin and thick lines as differentiators thanks to the S-pen. I then made my decision that I would return the note 2 and wait for the note 3 because of the larger screen, and faster processor. In addition, I had a memory intensive Anatomy app running on the note 2 that smoothly ran it, when my HP touchpad running android decided to begin hiccupping. Now with all that said, this is why I feel the note 3 is the best choice on the market. First of all, if your going to purchase a phone that you are spending your hard earned money on it, it should be in the most secure and safest cases. It's an investment, that when 2 years later you sell back, you can almost pay for your new device. Second of all, we will ALL drop our phones at SOME POINT, and its important to protect them. I purchased the Spigen Bounce case despite it being slightly ugly; I got the gray one because Incipio NGP tpu cases are NOT yet available for this phone. That case kept my razr maxx in like new condition. Now, I really protect my phone because I have my entire life on it, my class schedule, my hospital schedule, my family schedule, my kids doctors appointments, my appointments, my tests etc. EVERYTHING. So I needed a phone that was behind me 100% and never let me down. It has been the case with the note 3. I have customized it and it still hasn't hiccupped yet. Now the actual review: Screen & Productivity: The large display is fantastic. It is large enough to hold a full month calendar on one home screen and 3 days on another. I absolutely love the vivid screen because my anatomy apps, as well as using it to take notes is an absolute breeze. My only recommendation is to add many pages before you begin in lecture or whatever you want to take notes in. There are many times where I find inspirational quotes on Facebook (FB) and wish I could save them and tag them to share not via FB but text messages etc. Scrap book has allowed me to do just that, I can share inspirational quotes and pictures with anyone and it's a breeze to look them up by placing my OWN PERSONAL tags for each photo. I hold the menu button, type inspiration and BAM; I have all my things that are tagged inspirational. Sometimes I also need a list of diagnostic medical conditions, and it's easy to quickly create a scrapbook memo or create a flow chart in S-note. Etc. In fact the other day, I was talking to Verizon and needed to write down the conformational code etc. for my second note 3, and you know what I did? I was on the dialer page, pulled out the S-pen and circled the page, then I notated it with all the information, it contains the date, the time, and all the information I need to have in case something went awry. I absolutely love this feature and it is very important. Another feature I love is that when I am on YouTube, I can load HD very quickly, the LG g2 did a good job in this too, but the razr maxx despite being an LTE phone did not handle this very well. Another thing I really love on this phone straight out of the gate is that it tells me how many text messages I have (like an unread count). Its something I like, it also has many accounts built right in, such as amazon, Facebook etc. I was able to disable most of the bloat ware by going to manage applications and clicking disable in some of the pre-loaded Verizon apps. The IR blaster is great, I've already started using it on all my TV's however, it wont turn the volume up on my LG TV but do every else. In addition, I am able to have in memory which room has which TV and so when I switch rooms, I also switch rooms on my phone, which allows me to use it as a remote. Great when you have to hide the remote from your little ones. Battery Life: Used it for an entire day hardcore, and its still at 31% at the end of the day after about 6 am to 1 am usage. UPDATE 10.23.13- see the attached screen shot of battery usage. I was pretty impressed. I do know for a fact though that S- health eats battery life like crazy. Also I LOVE the speaker placement on the bottom of the phone, because it's just smart. When I hold my phone, it cups around the speaker channeling the sound directly to me, and not the entire audience behind my phone. Smart. People have complained about the flip board app, but keep in mind, this is android and not IOS. We have choices here. Download an app called home 2 shortcut and it allowed me to configure double tapping the home button to start Google now rather than anything else. Its fantastic and a great use of android capabilities. (I will update more here) The S-pen I received was faulty with my phone, and so Verizon sent me a brand new one for free. Not taking off stars for that, during the pre-order stage stuff like that happens every once in a while. The Spen was completely usable I just had to add a little extra pressure. But no worries, it's taken care of and all is well. The power button has a slight lag when you just tap it to turn on the screen; if you give it a robust tap it comes on quicker. It is quickest to turn on the screen using the home button when it's sleeping. It kind of irritates me that it is that way. NOTE 10.23.13 It maybe quicker to use the HOME button to do the same thing. I wish Samsung allowed customization of the LED colors for the types of notifications. Note 10.23.13 Re: reception issues- I know people have complained about reception issues, but truly I haven't had many. Just a couple here and there. I think the reality is that the Note 3 is SLOW at switching networks etc. So rather than wait, I have just downloaded a refresh network app, which does what I need in less than 15 seconds and gives me a fresh connection. I don't see it as much of an inconvenience especially because the many positives of this device outweigh this one negative. I haven't had no reception anywhere. Tethering by the has been pretty amazingly fast with this phone, and it DOES NOT GET HOT!!!! I love that! My razr maxx used to be a meteorite when it was tethering. More to come. UPDATE 12.13.13 I apologize it has been a while to update. I absolutely still love this phone, and I wouldnt change much about my review. I will say that I have experience reception issues but they are SOOO SELDOM, I believe ive refreshed the network about 4-5 times since I have wrote the initial review and now. Ive been informed that there IS an app that allows you to customize the colors of the LED to what you want. Excellent, so thats definitely a negative taken away. I had been using my phone with a Spigen screen protector and initially I liked it, but now with using the S-pen and it aging I really am beginning to dislike that screen protector. I have just ordered a tempered glass screen protector and will update later about that. ONE thing I have learned is to save EVERYTHING from action memo to Scrapbook or S-Note if you want to hold onto it in case your phone needs to be reset. I had to reset my phone once, but it was due to the FoxFi app and it causing certificate issues. Once I reset it it fixed it. Another note, the Spigen case protector I was talking about, it is great, however I have found that the squared edges make it uncomfortable for my hand to hold, when I remove the case I can handle the phone pretty easily with one hand (even though I have hands on the smaller side). So I have ordered a case that has rounded edges rather than squared edges. Whatever you do, do NOT get a metal case for your phone because it will reduce your signal quality. Other than that the phone has been running great, and I will update it again soon!",597.0,14-10-2013,647.0,10053
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Mentor,True,5,"Fantastic phone. I loved all the specs on this phone when I was doing my research. For the most part it seemed that the phone was pretty solid for performance based on everything I was reading. My primary concern going in was the issue that I kept seeing appear regarding the call quality. I finally pulled the trigger when I saw that there was a fix for that issue. I have had the phone for over a month now and I can report that I have had no issues with any aspect of the phone. Call quality has been great. I have had no problems with running any apps and even multiple apps at a time, it does not lag. The battery life is the best of any phone I have ever owned. Even better than the extended battery I had for my previous phone. I can typically go at least 2 days on a charge. I consider myself to be an average user of the phone. On a typical day I will run several apps, send and receive multiple texts, do some surfing and make several phone calls. The size of the phone may be the sticking point for some people. I was a little hesitant in this respect also at first, but I can say that I got used to the size in a very short time and now can't imagine myself with a smaller phone. I love it. I think this phone was a great purchase and am not disappointed in it at all.",1.0,19-02-2014,3.0,1280

Have had it over a month now and am extremely pleased with the Note 3. I had the Samsung Galaxy S III and was 2 yrs old. Was time to upgrade. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 has a solid reputation and rather than wait for the Note 4 with no track record I opted for the Note 3. Glad I did. Only one caveat I have found is do not buy a protective case that has a magnetic closure tab because that can interfere with the note hand writing function. Have had no issues getting used to thise phablet sized phone. In fact I find I'm preferring it because the screen is larger, makes texting much easier. Camera is surprisingly good for indoor photos but finding it's not as great for brightly lit scenes such as taking shots of landscapes using auto.

The Note 3 is a great rendition of the Android operating system; it's only shortcomings are really from the OS, not the hardware.Physically, it doesn't feel as big as its size, compared to other phones on the market, and Samsung has added some of their own tweaks to make the size even less of an issue - my biggest complaint is that too many of the apps, and the interface itself, simply make everything bigger on the big screen, rather than taking advantage of the size to include more usable content ... there's no reason why a screen this size still only has 4 columns of app icons! But there are other front-ends available that remedy that situation, making the Note 3 an even better tool. The phone works well, but its interface is just about the worst I've seen; again, it's an OS issue, and Android needs to 'borrow' some ideas from HP's excellent-but-defunct WebOS. Connectivity has been excellent, both 4G and Wi-Fi; the 13MP camera is outstanding, the S-Pen makes editing, sketching and note-taking a breeze.",0.0,16-11-2014,2.0,1068

I mainly upgraded from the NoteII for the camera which I use everyday to capture kids/moments. For that alone it is a big improvement (8mb to 13mb + a bunch more modes & controls). There are voice commands & New S pen capabilities. So it is worth it for me because I use all of them a lot. If you are torn between the note 2 or note 3 I would go with the 3.

Like other good quality smart phones, this phone is well made and has great performance. There for, it is better to write about features this p hone has and others don't. The size of the screen and quality or clarity it has kept me away from my computer. I basically do almost everything with this phone. What separates it from other phones is the ability to take notes using the included S Pen with ease. You can actually write down something on the notepad and let you link it to something else. For example, you can write down someone's phone and click on it to initiate the dial keypad. Or write a website or physical address and click on that to bring up a browser or a Google map to navigate. Basically there is no other phone that competes with galaxy note 3 in this regard. With the auto correction feature when typing something, it is difficult to have typos in what you are writing. The thing that follows your eye when reading to help you scroll works but not sure how to make it do that on purpose. It just does it every now and then. When reading small prints, you can hover over the content with a finger and it magnifies the content. A lot of cool features I have yet to figure out. The battery life is great.

I hate Samsung's bloatware, joke of a UI, and their build construction. Coming from several years of using Apple products and now the new HTC One M8, the Samsung phones feel like children toys. To be fair, there are some intuitive features about the Note 3 (use of stylus) but I just can't stand how much bloatware is on this thing. If it were my phone, I would have returned it already.

Final Thoughts: LOVE IT, best phone yet. See below for more detailed thoughts. Pros: Blazing fast. With the 3GB RAM and Quad core processor you will NEVER run out of resources. LTE is blazing fast, seems to turn on faster than Huge screen with gorilla glass 3 (you wouldn't believe the difference even from galaxy nexus with it's ""scratch resistant"" glass). 1080p resolution (enough said). Very long lasting battery. With that 5.7inch screen you better believe it will suck down power. The battery delivers. You can root it, it's a pain but it's doable. Camera is really nice. Custom built in camera and gallery apps are not as good as stock but still pretty good. USB 3.0 - They barely brag about this! The USB 3.0 chord and charger that comes with the phone is amazing. The phone will charge from 0-100 in like 40 minutes with the USB 3 cable. Transferring files is extremely fast with the USB 3 cable (must have a USB 3 port which most new laptops and motherboards have). USB 2 cables and chargers still work with it, the charge is just a little slower. Don't freak out when you see the new male portion of the USB cable, it's not proprietary, it's USB 3 and it is still backwards compatible (the right side of the USB 3 cable is the same as just USB 2). Cons: The bootloader is locked so I can't load custom ROMs. The bloatware is annoying but it's to be expected. NFC doesn't work with Google Wallet even rooted- Annoying, but I think then are working on it. From what I understand it's a hardware thing where the new NFC format isn't compatible. S Pen is useless for me. Waste of space in the handset. I'm sure it's useful for some. It's good for defacing pictures of people that you take. Final Thoughts: LOVE IT, best phone yet. I'll be glad to answer any questions.",4.0,22-04-2014,6.0,1990

My last phone (Droid Bionic) lasted two days max. Alright, I'm not a really heavy user. I check email a couple of times a day. I make 6-10 phone calls a day. I do some web browsing when away from my desktop computer and run a few apps. OTOH, I'm often connected to wifi (at home or away). Bluetooth is off right now, so that probably saves some juice. What I miss from the Droid was the availability of dedicated docks for car and desk. But it would overheat in the windshield dock, which I'm hoping won't happen with the Note 3. One other negative I've noticed is the placement of the power button opposite the volume rockers. I have to be careful to only press the power switch. I'm a 6' tall guy and the size of this is not a problem. I chose it as a way to have a single device rather than carry a tablet in addition to my phone. Carrying it in a pocket of a travel vest is no problem. I think it would be too large to carry on a belt. The camera seems to perform like a phone camera: OK in good light only. At a dimly-lit party with flash on produced smeared images due to excess in-device noise reduction. Love the size for browsing my calendar and email. Web browsing is better than on a phone, but not really competition for a tablet. Just getting accustomed to the S Pen and find it better than a conventional stylus. Have barely scratched the surface of the extra functions. Speaking of just scratching the surface, I find that I'm going to have to set aside time to partake of some tutorials in order to really get the most out of the Note 3. My first smart phone was a Blackberry six years ago, then I graduated to the Droid Bionic. The power of this phone -- plus features of Android 4.3 -- encourage me to learn to live up to what it can do. Since this is my only portable device, I went for a SanDisk Extreme 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I memory card, which brings my total available storage close to 100 GB ... might as well be equipped to take maximum advantage of this beast.",10.0,17-12-2013,15.0,2074

Also, biggest issue is not being able to tether phone to computer via USB to work on files. With so much storage available (I have a 64GB card in addition to the 32GB on board) I feel like its a waste and have to use Google Drive now...which sucks data up very quickly.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Stephen Popolizio,True,5,"Screw any iPhone 5, 5C, 5S .... There's a new Bad Boy out there called the Note 3.. If you are tired of an iPhone (which I'd imagine no one is... sad because the iPhone 4 to the 4S was a bigger leap from the 4S to any of the 5's . . . why? Steve Jobs. Sadly he is gone and apple will never be the same) get the GALAXY NOTE 3!!! Yes it does suck a little because you don't have seamless integration via other Mac products. Guess what? Who cares?! This is a far superior phone and I could go into specs but just read the reviews because I'm too lazy to write them. I had a 4s for two years, then got the 5s and was disappointed to them max!Fix the freakin' aspect ratio you fools. This is the third iPhone 5 and they still fell flat. Pathetic. Truly unacceptable. It's not even 16x9. Why? Yep, no Steve Jobs. This is rudimentary and Apple still doesn't get it. Unacceptable. So I got the Note 3. This baby will blow you away. And if you get a wallet case (Cellto wallet case is awesome) then it is not that bad at all to put up to your ear. It begins to not feel like a tablet (which is beneficial because this pretty much is a tablet too). Amazing Phone. Proud of Samsung for getting it together and delivering! And then some. Love the Pen as I am a filmmaker and just creative :) GET IT!!!! I realize most out there aren't tech save. So have fun with your iPhone. The Galaxy Note 3 combines both worlds. Technicality and user friendliness. Don't believe or don't care? Have fun with an inferior phone. And I love Apple. Always have had both PC and Mac computers. But innovation will never match what Steve Jobs did for Apple. He laid out the blueprints for multiple devices to the world to expand on. I guess Apple didn't get the memo. Clearly. They've reached their pinnacle and can only attempt to catch up to what was already handed to them. Again, pathetic. Disappointing. If you're serious in getting a great phone, buy the Note 3. If not, get whatever the hell you want. It will be inferior. Choose as you will. To each is our own.",1.0,17-01-2014,3.0,2037

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Amazon Customer,True,5,"WOW!. I purchased the Note 3 after a good deal of consideration and research. First off I should relate that I'm into computers. I took my first computer course in 1972 (Fortran) and have kept up with developments ever sence. I built my own gaming/general purpose rig and repair, modify and troubleshoot computers. I enjoy it. I have been watching the development of cellphones with the same interest. My first cellphone was a Motorola bag phone (remember those?) and have upgraded only when I saw a definite improvement in functionallity but never did so as a matter of fashion. Late last year I decided that it was time to replace my six year old LG ""dumb"" phone. I also had become interested in buying a high end tablet after seeing some of my young in-laws using theirs during the Holidays. I had the thought that it would be great if you could buy a nice tablet that also made phone calls! Of course nothing like that exists. I then began taking a harder look at the high end phones after seeing a HSN show on the iPhone and decided it was time to finally make the jump to a ""smart"" phone. I concluded that the technology had matured to finally deliver the the functionallity that it promised and still be user friendly. After much research I settled on the Samsung. I looked briefly at the S4 but felt it was to small to replicate the tablet experience that I wanted. I'm a Verizon customer (no particular loyality, they just happen to have the best service for my area) so I went to the Verizon store to check out the phone with a salesperson and maybe get a deal. Because they are so new there are no deals on the Note 3. If you feel you can wait a year the phone will certainly be cheaper and in two years it will probably be free with a renewal/upgrade. Verizon wanted $350 for the phone plus $30 to connect it. They also charge a monthly fee for data use. Not the plan use that you contract for but just a fee to use data. SCAM! but what you gonna do? I then went to my old faithful, AMAZON! They listed the Verizon ready phone for $229 with no extra charges. I went back to the Verizon store and told them that if they couldn't match the price there was no way I could ignore a $160 difference. They couldn't so I went home and ordered the phone. I'm an Amazon Prime member ( as an aside: if you order more than three things a year from Amazon, seriously, join Prime. I ordered a forty inch TV for a Christmas gift and it arrived in two days. Free. Wow) and I got a notice that because of high demand my delivery would take a few extra days. I thought; no big deal. I wasn't even really supprised when two days after my order the package showed up on my doorstep. I opened the package and went through the basic setup. I did have to call Verizon support but they were very gracious about connecting and initializing the phone. Now, about the phone. This thing is amazing. The closest approximation I can think of is a laptop the makes phone calls and takes (really good!) pictures. I am new to the whole ""smart"" phone experience as I indicated and have been constantly amazed by the functionallity, capability, and potential of the device. I mean; dual core processor, 3 gigs of RAM, 96 gigs of storage with the expansion slot. By way of comparison my first store bought desktop computer had an industry leading 45 gigs!. The Android OS is Linux based so it has some subtle differences but not to the point of being a problem for PC users. There is definitely a steep learning curve if, like me, you are new to the whole tablet/smartphone experience. It came with almost no user instruction other than initial setup. I went online and found the Samsung users manual and downloaded it. 256 pages if you skip all the lawyer stuff in the front. I also got a book on my Kindle account (free) that also helps but I am convinced that, like most electronic gizmos that are continuously developing, by the time I figure out how to really use it I'll be ready for the ""next"" thing. YouTube is also a great resource for instruction on the phone and the various apps. As to the apps; if you order the phone from Amazon it comes pre-loaded with all the Amazon apps and they cannot be uninstalled but why would you want to? And because Google owns the Android OS you are joined at the hip to Google and all its apps and anoying behavior and no, you cannot get rid of it. I have used Google since it first came out in beta but I find them rather spooky. I'm sure the same problem (or worse) exists with the iPhone. One of the first things I noticed about the phone was the very poor battery life. I was used to my old phone keeping a charge for days and I noticed I was only getting 5-6 hours of time on the Note. I researched the situation and found that you should perform a certain ammount of cleanup on the new phone. Built in utillities can accomplish this but the best solution is to download an app called All-In-One Toolbox. Get it from the Amazon AppStore for free. It is a highly regarded app and makes the list of top ten downloads consistently. Using the app's function of disabiling background resource hogs you can up your battery life to maybe a day and a half. Bottom line, the Note 3 is a battery hog so you can just count on keeping it on a charger when not using it. The up side is that it charges fairly quickly. Physicaly, the phone is large. Even for my 6'2"" oversized hands. I find myself constantly fumbling around when using it, trying to find a comfortable position. Another problem is when shifting the grip on the phone I inadvertently press one of the soft keys and thereby change the screen. Annoying but something that I'm sure would be a problem with any phone and particularly with smaller phones, i.e. S4. I just looked up and realized its 3 A.M. I thought this review would be about two paragraphs. I'll try to add more impressions later. Bottom line; this device is, in its small way, a life changer. Like I stated earlier, a laptop that makes phone calls. It's just a little too large and heavy, with a protective case (which I recommend), to fit in a shirt pocket but I have no trouble finding a way to carry it. And all those times in the past when I was away from home and I wanted to do something that required a computer and internet access and was frustrated are now history. I guess I'm now a connected dude!",6.0,16-02-2014,8.0,6350

For me that was not the case at all. I can't speak for everyone though, and I would encourage anyone looking to buy this phone to look at it in the store, and see what it feels like in the pocket, etc. The phone isn't tablets sized, it's still just a big phone. I have no problem putting it in pockets, but I have big pockets. What I really like about this phone is that it really blurs the line on what a phone is vs. a tablet / a kindle / a portable game system. This phone has no problem doing any of those things. I can use full web pages, not just the mobile versions. I can read a book from the google play library or the kindle types very easily. It plays plants vs zombies 2, minecraft pocket edition, stuff like that. The battery life is excellent. You'll only get a few hours gaming, but doing almost everything else, you get quite a lot. It charges quickly. The screen is gorgeous. The stylus is quite handy - I find myself using it quite a bit. I like the fact that it's attached into the phone, making it difficult to lose (there's a setting where the phone reminds you not to leave your stylus behind if you walk away).

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,CPFlorida,True,3,"Good to Great Device if You Don't Care About the UI. This phone (phablet), in reality, should get a 5. The screen is absolutely fantastic. The device, though large, feels great in hand. The stylus, with the quick actions that launch automatically and also when you push the button (and air gestures) works very well. The phone's battery life is unreal. I got easily 2 days worth fo use without charging, and a solid day of HEAVY usage. And the SD Card slot is so underrated these days, as well as the removable battery. The ""leather"" back didn't look or feel cheap to me. And the phone turns a lot of heads, fid that's your thing. It's definitely a step up from the Note 2. Okay, so why didn't I give this phone a 5, or even a 4? According to the rating guideline, a 5 is ""I love it,"" a 4 is ""I like it."" Well I liked it at first, but never loved it. But over the course of a week I ended up not really liking it. I tried to give myself time to get used to the interface and it never happened. I changed the launcher, tried to tweak the settings, even tried some themes. Ultimately it came down to the user interface is just awful. The colors are not consistent between the different apps and settings. The Samsung touchwiz software and verizon stuff get in your way more than they help. Coming from a Galaxy Nexus, the UI was just jarring to me. I didn't care for the hard buttons either, although that's just a preference. The way the Samsung framework is set up, there's no easy way to enable on screen keys either. Overall I was just not happy with the UI and the UX. Also, the screen ppi settings are wrong for a screen of this size. everything is ""too big."" Samsung could have tweaked it down a bit to make use of the 1920x1080 screen. As it is, you don;t really get any more usable room in apps than you would in a Galaxy Note 2. The only places you'll really see the screen shine with pictures, games, web and video. For me anyway, all other apps seemed to be overblown because the PPI settings are wrong. So I gave it a 3, because overall I think ""it's okay."" I ended up getting an LG G2. I like that phone a lot better. The LG user interface is more customizable and doesn't remind you of old Android, but more in line with the new Android 4.x user interface. Plus, the G2 is capable of being flashed with Cyanogenmod, if that's your thing. Unlike the Note 3, you don;t have to give up the stylus to do that. Other features like air gestures, eye tracking etc are just gimmicks to me anyway.",16.0,20-11-2013,21.0,2501

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Critical Reviewer,False,5,"I really was reluctant to purchase a Samsung device but then all that changed. All right here is an honest review about the note 3. It's something that I will approach from the perspective of someone in the Medical field, who needs to get things done quickly, and efficiently. First of all, I received my phone on October 10th, and I had pre-ordered it but DID NOT pay 299. Well initially I did, but there is a promo code of VERIZON30 that drops the note 3 down to 209.99. I bought the Note 3 for myself and the LG G2 for my wife. Needless to say, at the price of 139.99 for the G2 and 209.99 for the Note 3, we returned the G2 for the note 3 despite the G2's incredible low light camera performance. Here is why. Backstory: prior to buying the note 3 I have had the Droid Razr Maxx, which for its time was a great device. Now that apps are becoming more memory intensive, something needed to change. I needed a phone that wouldn't lag on me, and I really don't care about gimmicks such as scrolling while looking up or down, or pausing a video if I look away. Who really cares about that stuff? If I want to pause, I tap on the screen, which is less time consuming that looking away and ensuring my phone has paused playing a video. In addition, I really don't want that front facing camera on unless I am using it. Also, I was always reluctant to buy a Samsung phone because of the plastic build, but you know I always keep my phone in a safe case. I will talk about this a little later. Now, right before I let go of my razr maxx, I briefly upgraded to the note 2 for 2 days. I chose the note 2 because I was in best buy and was comparing the HTC ONE which best buy had on sale for $50 and all of a sudden I decided to listen to the note 2's speaker. I was blown away in comparison to the razr maxx, but blown away which how much more I got in comparison to the HTC one. We are all going to large screens now, and frankly who the heck wants to hold the phone closer to their face? I certainly don't so I upgraded to the note 2. I really did not fall in love with it until the day I was sitting in my senior human cadaver anatomy course, and realized I had forgotten my Anatomy atlas and my notebook. I frantically searched the note 2 and found an app called S Note. I opened S note and began using it. I was blow away, there are blood vessels that are large and really thing, and I used to be able to only differentiate that on paper. Not this time, with the note 2 I was able to use the thin and thick lines as differentiators thanks to the S-pen. I then made my decision that I would return the note 2 and wait for the note 3 because of the larger screen, and faster processor. In addition, I had a memory intensive Anatomy app running on the note 2 that smoothly ran it, when my HP touchpad running android decided to begin hiccupping. Now with all that said, this is why I feel the note 3 is the best choice on the market. First of all, if your going to purchase a phone that you are spending your hard earned money on it, it should be in the most secure and safest cases. It's an investment, that when 2 years later you sell back, you can almost pay for your new device. Second of all, we will ALL drop our phones at SOME POINT, and its important to protect them. I purchased the Spigen Bounce case despite it being slightly ugly; I got the gray one because Incipio NGP tpu cases are NOT yet available for this phone. That case kept my razr maxx in like new condition. Now, I really protect my phone because I have my entire life on it, my class schedule, my hospital schedule, my family schedule, my kids doctors appointments, my appointments, my tests etc. EVERYTHING. So I needed a phone that was behind me 100% and never let me down. It has been the case with the note 3. I have customized it and it still hasn't hiccupped yet. Now the actual review: Screen & Productivity: The large display is fantastic. It is large enough to hold a full month calendar on one home screen and 3 days on another. I absolutely love the vivid screen because my anatomy apps, as well as using it to take notes is an absolute breeze. My only recommendation is to add many pages before you begin in lecture or whatever you want to take notes in. There are many times where I find inspirational quotes on Facebook (FB) and wish I could save them and tag them to share not via FB but text messages etc. Scrap book has allowed me to do just that, I can share inspirational quotes and pictures with anyone and it's a breeze to look them up by placing my OWN PERSONAL tags for each photo. I hold the menu button, type inspiration and BAM; I have all my things that are tagged inspirational. Sometimes I also need a list of diagnostic medical conditions, and it's easy to quickly create a scrapbook memo or create a flow chart in S-note. Etc. In fact the other day, I was talking to Verizon and needed to write down the conformational code etc. for my second note 3, and you know what I did? I was on the dialer page, pulled out the S-pen and circled the page, then I notated it with all the information, it contains the date, the time, and all the information I need to have in case something went awry. I absolutely love this feature and it is very important. Another feature I love is that when I am on YouTube, I can load HD very quickly, the LG g2 did a good job in this too, but the razr maxx despite being an LTE phone did not handle this very well. Another thing I really love on this phone straight out of the gate is that it tells me how many text messages I have (like an unread count). Its something I like, it also has many accounts built right in, such as amazon, Facebook etc. I was able to disable most of the bloat ware by going to manage applications and clicking disable in some of the pre-loaded Verizon apps. The IR blaster is great, I've already started using it on all my TV's however, it wont turn the volume up on my LG TV but do every else. In addition, I am able to have in memory which room has which TV and so when I switch rooms, I also switch rooms on my phone, which allows me to use it as a remote. Great when you have to hide the remote from your little ones. Battery Life: Used it for an entire day hardcore, and its still at 31% at the end of the day after about 6 am to 1 am usage. UPDATE 10.23.13- see the attached screen shot of battery usage. I was pretty impressed. I do know for a fact though that S- health eats battery life like crazy. Also I LOVE the speaker placement on the bottom of the phone, because it's just smart. When I hold my phone, it cups around the speaker channeling the sound directly to me, and not the entire audience behind my phone. Smart. People have complained about the flip board app, but keep in mind, this is android and not IOS. We have choices here. Download an app called home 2 shortcut and it allowed me to configure double tapping the home button to start Google now rather than anything else. Its fantastic and a great use of android capabilities. (I will update more here) The S-pen I received was faulty with my phone, and so Verizon sent me a brand new one for free. Not taking off stars for that, during the pre-order stage stuff like that happens every once in a while. The Spen was completely usable I just had to add a little extra pressure. But no worries, it's taken care of and all is well. The power button has a slight lag when you just tap it to turn on the screen; if you give it a robust tap it comes on quicker. It is quickest to turn on the screen using the home button when it's sleeping. It kind of irritates me that it is that way. NOTE 10.23.13 It maybe quicker to use the HOME button to do the same thing. I wish Samsung allowed customization of the LED colors for the types of notifications. Note 10.23.13 Re: reception issues- I know people have complained about reception issues, but truly I haven't had many. Just a couple here and there. I think the reality is that the Note 3 is SLOW at switching networks etc. So rather than wait, I have just downloaded a refresh network app, which does what I need in less than 15 seconds and gives me a fresh connection. I don't see it as much of an inconvenience especially because the many positives of this device outweigh this one negative. I haven't had no reception anywhere. Tethering by the has been pretty amazingly fast with this phone, and it DOES NOT GET HOT!!!! I love that! My razr maxx used to be a meteorite when it was tethering. More to come. UPDATE 12.13.13 I apologize it has been a while to update. I absolutely still love this phone, and I wouldnt change much about my review. I will say that I have experience reception issues but they are SOOO SELDOM, I believe ive refreshed the network about 4-5 times since I have wrote the initial review and now. Ive been informed that there IS an app that allows you to customize the colors of the LED to what you want. Excellent, so thats definitely a negative taken away. I had been using my phone with a Spigen screen protector and initially I liked it, but now with using the S-pen and it aging I really am beginning to dislike that screen protector. I have just ordered a tempered glass screen protector and will update later about that. ONE thing I have learned is to save EVERYTHING from action memo to Scrapbook or S-Note if you want to hold onto it in case your phone needs to be reset. I had to reset my phone once, but it was due to the FoxFi app and it causing certificate issues. Once I reset it it fixed it. Another note, the Spigen case protector I was talking about, it is great, however I have found that the squared edges make it uncomfortable for my hand to hold, when I remove the case I can handle the phone pretty easily with one hand (even though I have hands on the smaller side). So I have ordered a case that has rounded edges rather than squared edges. Whatever you do, do NOT get a metal case for your phone because it will reduce your signal quality. Other than that the phone has been running great, and I will update it again soon!",242.0,14-10-2013,272.0,10053

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Ashton P. Johnson,False,5,"My perfect phone. I've been a fan of the bigger sized phones for some time and Samsung has been paving the way in terms of quality large phones. I remember when I had the 4.5in screened Samsung Infuse and it was considered large. I've had a Note and Note 2 and loved both. Note 3 continues the tradition of keeping everything that worked, improving where needed, and adding features I wouldn't have even thought to ask. So many of the little annoyances I had with my Note 2 have been addressed. Its clear they put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed. When I first held the phone I fell in love. The form factor is just great and the screen is a noticeable jump up. That's saying something when the Note 2 already had a stellar screen resolution. I don't feel the need to have this one in a case. The slippery back of the Note 2 required a case as I dropped it a couple times when holding it bare. Rather than go on feature by feature I'll suffice to say everything feels like a great and noticeable improvement. S-pen, camera, battery life, screen, on and on its the phone I loved before but better in every way I could have asked for. I've tried dozens of smartphones over the past 5 years. The Note 2 was the first one I actually held onto for a year. I easily see myself holding onto the 3 that much or longer (depending on when they bring out a 4th ;) ). I highly recommend this phone.",59.0,10-10-2013,69.0,1424
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Hobbled,False,5,"Some Advantages to this phone you might not have considered.. Three things you might not have considered about this phone: Admittedly, I'm an atypical cell phone user. I don't actually make or receive a lot of calls--probably because I was a very late adopter of the technology. I was finally forced into buying one for a job that required it. Nonetheless, I've been very happy with this phone. Here are three great things about it you might not have considered: 1) It sounds fantastic. I'm not referring to the quality of the microphone or speakers (although they are pretty good) for phonecalls but the amplifier used for playing .mp3 and .mp4 files. With a good set of headphones, music on this phone sounds great! Far better than it did on the iPod touch I was using before I bought this phone. If you're an audiophile and rely your phone for portable music, this is a great choice. Also, the easily replaceable SD memory card means that you have the memory capacity to rip lots of songs at the highest bit rates. 2) It seems almost waterproof. Twice, I've accidentally immersed this phone completely in fresh water. After opening it up, removing the battery and all the cards as well as the S pen, and drying it out, it still works perfectly. Not that I'd recommend dunking your phone any longer than you have to. Maybe I've just been lucky. 3) The battery (easily replaceable) has long life and charges incredibly quickly. Anyway, some bonuses to buying this phone in addition to the beautiful, big display and the stylus--two of the main reasons that I purchased it.",1.0,06-09-2015,3.0,1573
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Chris,False,1,"Two examples of this phone destroyed pictures from my SD card! (And more!). I was a very happy Galaxy S 3 user, so when it came time to renew, I wanted another Samsung. Here's every reason why that was a poor choice: -I'm going to say first that I had an insurance claim put on my first phone (a four-foot drop was enough to kill it completely) and get a refurbished one, and some of these problems happened on both -First phone corrupted my SD card and cost me a lot of pictures -Second one magically 'disappeared' hundreds of pictures on my SD card (they're also missing when I put the card in my computer to check, so they really are gone) -Second phone's wifi stopped working (doesn't turn on) after about two weeks -Second phone's pen stylus sensor has never worked; has huge dead spots and spots where the cursor jumps all over the screen -Camera is garbage; can't focus close, usually quite slow to take a picture, and has a green/magenta hue when in low light (this is consistent with both phones) -Samsung's deviated enough from plain-jane Android that it's normal for apps to just not get along with this particular phone, which happened when I had to move bank funds between accounts for a time-sensitive emergency purchase and the app kept restarting -Comes pre-loaded with a feel-good Galaxy Note 3 instrumental song that will occasionally play by default when you go to play music over Bluetooth -To its credit, battery life is still better than any phone I've had before. Overall, this phone seems extremely poorly thought-out as compared to my last one, and I won't buy another Samsung. I'm going to get a third warranty replacement after this one's gone so wrong in terms of wifi and the pen stylus, and before it can destroy any more of my pictures.

It's still able to run everything all the latest phones can. I see no reason to upgrade. What it has over the current gen phones Note 7 is: 1. Removable battery. After a couple years the phone battery doesn't last as long. I'm replacing the 3200mAh batter with a 7500mAh which will increase the life of the phone to twice as long. Try that with your Note 7! 2. Removable microSD card. I can keep upgrading the memory stick inside and actually have more storage than the current gen Note phones. 3. Easily rootable. Sure Samsung stops sending updates for the older models of phones. Doesn't matter because there is still a vibrant aftermarket for the Note 3 operating systems. Rooting will also allow you to remove the bloatware that comes with most phones. 4. Cheaper accessories. Aftermarket larger capacity batteries, cases, screen protectors, car mounts... it's all cheaper because this is an older model phone and the demand has died down.",1.0,03-08-2016,3.0,1037

The camera performs very well outdoors in bright, well-lit areas. The photos are crisp and clear, no blurriness at all.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Kiyo M.,False,5,"The BEST phone ever. A class of its own.. If you're looking for a new phone and size is not an issue (and you're not biased towards Apple products), don't think: This is the best phone out there to get. There's a reason why the current king of basketball, Lebron James, is endorsing this phone. It is simply the BEST phone..tablet... phablet... mini computer, entertainment, gadget and reason why Samsung has taken over Apple. The only reason I can see people not wanting this is the size. (or prefer iOS over Android software) I used to be one of those people who thought it looked silly having a phone this size when the first Note came out; however, with tablets becoming more prevalent, and being extremely useful to have daily, having a screen size this big is fantastic. The size really doesn't make it an inconvenience at all as it is slim and easily fits in a pocket. I can wear skinny jeans and the phone can still comfortably fit. I use my phone a lot more now than my tablets. This phone is loaded with features, that even if size becomes a problem to you, there is a One Handed Operation setting where you can adjust the screen smaller! (See TIPS below) It's very useful! I tried out the Note 3 at an actual store and I was instantly envious and sold. I could not wait for my upgrade contract to come.. ----- Upgraded from HTC Rezound (my old phone) ----- My old previous phone was an HTC Rezound. I could not stand that phone! It would get HOT just talking on the phone (It was so uncomfortable putting my ear next to the phone), the battery life was horrible (I bought like 4 spare batteries for it!), and it would lag so much trying to make one simple phone call, it gave me so much headache I had to upgrade right away. I can't believe how sluggish my old phone really was, as the Note 3 runs smooth like butter. The screen is gorgeous. I can last an entire day with the battery and using it heavily. The Note 3 is a major breath of fresh air! The Note 3 really makes my old phone or any other phone look like a kid's toy phone. Despite the larger screen size, it is still much lighter and slimmer. The Galaxy Note 3 is a luxury first class experience. With the powerful processor and 3GB Ram, it is smooth! ----- Pros: - Beautiful 5.7"" Super AMOLED capacitive LARGE touchscreen. Great size and colors. (1920x1080) - Runs so smooth! Fast processor and plenty of memory - 3GB! - Dual Window screen (you can watch YouTube while browsing the web and whatnot; processor/memory is powerful enough to give you a nice experience) - it's like a mini computer! - Does NOT get hot at all while talking! (This device doesn't break a sweat!) - Slim and light - S-Pen is a great amazing feature exclusive to Samsung (You can draw notes and it can automatically convert it text); you can do so much with this pen. - Excellent battery life - Fast charging via USB 3.0 cable (you can still charge using a micro-USB cable, but it also takes commonly available USB 3.0 cables for much faster charging!) Cons: - When you double press the home screen, it pops up ""My Magazine"" app by default. They should allow the user the freedom to assign that to something they want. ----- TIPS: ------ - Best way to take screen shots is using the S-Pen; hold the side button on the S-Pen and then press down/hold on the screen - it will take a screen shot AND allow you to edit the screenshot on the fly (This is great for pointing out something on the screen or whatnot for sending quickly) - You can also take screenshots by putting your palm on the screen and swipe across like your hand is a scanner To do this, you have to go to Settings > Motions and gestures > Palm motion to ON - You can also hold on to the side button of the S-Pen and double tap the screen to open the ACTION MEMO right away. - To make the screen smaller, go to Settings > One-handed operation > Use for all screens to ON; when you swipe quickly from exactly at the side edge of the screen (so you would actually be feeling the silver sides) across and then back out to the edge of the screen, then it would shrink the screen (if that explanation is confusing, then just make a V-motion swipe on the edge) ----- CONCLUSION: ----- When it comes to screen size, battery life, features, there's just really no comparison to the Note 3. It is a league of its own. The Note 3 is future proof; although it came out in September of last year (2013), newer phones that have come out after is still no comparison to the ""King"" Note 3. The ""smaller verison"" Samsung S5 was released recently this year, but it has less memory (2GB) and smaller battery life. I also have a Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, but it is a pleasure using the Note 3 and I use it more than the tablets now. This phone is easily worth 5 stars and the price. The Galaxy Watch also seems like a nice accessory to get, especially if the price becomes more reasonable. I'm aware the Note 4 will eventually come out, but I'm extremely happy to have this phone in my hands now instead of waiting months and using my old sluggish phone. I'm certainly happy with the Note 3 and I'm sure I'll definitely have a great experience with it until a Note 5 comes out... Highly recommended powerful device in your hands, worthy of the praise it gets from hundreds of people.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Amazon Customer,False,4,"Camera only so-so, Phone audio only so-so, Screen awesome. I want 2 main things in a phone - as good a camera as I can get and a screen that allows me to read. Screen is great. The picture is great, reading is excellent, and the stylus is a bonus. I use it sometimes, but not as often as I thought I would. i do draw with it sometimes and also make notes. Helpful, but not completely necessary. I like that it stores right in the phone though. The camera is better on the iPhone 5. Heck, the camera was better on my iPhone 4. There is no macro at all. So, you have to be pretty far away to focus - there is no low light. I mean, none. You have to use the flash which is only so-so or you have to just not take the picture. Same situation, my husband will take the picture with his iPhone 5 & it will come out. So, if a camera is your main focus, choose an iPhone. The audio quality is also not great. When played on speaker - music, or speaker phone, audio book - it is fine, but when talking on the phone, the quality is less than stellar. It is hard to hear (volume could go higher) because it does not come through as clearly as it had on my old iPhone 4 or on my husband's iPhone 5. Same network, same people I'm talking to, so I've tested and it is actually this phone. ALSO - it does not fit in a normal sized pocket and falls out, so consider this when purchasing. If you carry a bag all the time, that's great, but if not, do you have pants or a jacket with very large pockets? If no, you will have to carry it all the time. Also, in an evening bag, it is hard to fit. I was at a wedding last weekend and carried it separately. OVERALL - I love to read on my phone and it is amazing for that. I text almost all the time - also amazing for that. AND, when you do get good pictures, the viewing and editing on this phone is great.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,C.G.,False,5,"Best Phone (Note 3) on the Best Network (Verizon)!!. Having the best phone (as of the date of this review) on the best network (love or hate Verizon, no one can deny that the coverage is just there when and where you need it) with an unlimited data plan means that productivity will always be had with this device. Coming from the Note 2 (which I had for a couple of months before I sold it to someone coming from a HTC Thunderbolt...suffice it to say he loves life too), the FULL HD (1920x1080--1080p on this device!!), improved S-Pen, improved S-Voice (it's cute, but I would rather use Google Voice Search), what isn't there to love about this phone. Yes, there are people who will cry about the size. To those I say, the market is dictating that cell phone makers go big, or go home. I have big hands, and I can tell you that it feels good to have something in my hand(s) that won't feel like it'll break. Cell phone quality is excellent, the build is more sturdier than the Note 2 (there were people crying about a loose home button, but that wasn't in mine. I buy that defects could happen, but those are exceptions, not rules in regard to the Note 3.) My phone is currently awaiting a wallet case that experienced problems, but right now is housed in a Ventev case (which I reviewed) and a Spigen Ultra Crystal screen protector (full screen and I'll review that too, but BUY IT!! Really protects the phone!!!) Surfing the web, reading e-mail, streaming music from Google Play on High and no cache (because I got unlimited data... :D), the phone does it all with such speed. But the best part I love that beats the Note 2 hands down?! Battery Life!!! I have had this thing for a week and so far, the battery last a good day and half to 2 days before I even see a low percent. I have not used the MicroUSB 3.0 cable that came with the Note 3, because honestly, the million and one USB chargers with 2.0 cable do a great job charging my phone. All I would have done was open up yet one more USB cable, so I have left that in the box. Bottom line, buy this phone!! It is the best phone on the market AND it will be well over a year before this phone becomes ""old"" Full HD, MicroUSB 3.0, 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB internal space (coupled with the 32GB I stuck in there from my Droid Charge...) and much, much more. I could have written a more technical review, but you want to know how my experience is overall, and I'm telling you...I have never been so happy to early adopt a device.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Mike Tarrani,False,5,"Love mine - upgraded from a cracked screen Note II. Before giving my opinion and experiences with this phone I want to start with some advice if you are upgrading from another Android phone. Search Samsung's site for an app called Samsung Smart Switch. It's free and easy. If you find issues with that app for any reason you can move all of your text messages from your old phone to this one by loading a free app called SMS Backup & Restore and following the directions I outlined in my November 30, 2013 review of that product. Another free app you may want to consider is Software Data Cable, which allows you to back up your old Android phone to a laptop or PC, then move it to your new phone from that backup. You will need to load that app on your old phone and the Note 3, but it's simple and very handy. While the size difference between this and the Note 2 is only a matter of inches, the screen on this one is brighter, has more vivid colors and can be easily viewed in direct sunlight. The 32GB of internal storage is a big plus because the 16GB on my Note 2 was beginning to get full. When I added in my 64GB external SD card I swapped from the Note 2, total storage comes to 16GB more storage than my 80GB laptop. It's easy to forecast that the next version of this phone could finally wean me off computers. As it is I am spending a lot more time on my phone doing stuff I use to do on my computer. This is also a much faster phone. I do not use it to anywhere near its capacity, but it zips along from one screen or app to the next with no lag. I was more than pleased with my older Note 2, but this one is even better. I take a lot of pictures and video, so I appreciate the greatly improved camera resolution and the easier and more intuitive interface. But what I truly love is there are no major differences in the user interface even though this one runs under Android 4.3 versus 4.1.2 on my Note 2. In that respect there was zero learning curve. After tweaking a few settings that did not come over when I restored my old ones, I was up and running as before in practically no time. This ships with a cable that supports USB 3.0 and has what looks like a connector that is incompatible with existing micro USB chargers, that is not the case. You can still use existing chargers, battery packs and the such because their micro USB connectors will plug into one side of the charging port. If you have a computer capable of USB 3.0 your transfer rates will be lightning fast. The battery is about the same as the Note 2 for use time between charges. Since the Note 3's 4.3 Android operating system does include Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support you may notice a slightly improved use time if you use bluetooth a lot. As it stands there is a very slight difference between the Note 2's 3100mAh battery capacity and the 3200mAh one in this phone. I am still exploring the nuances of my new phone, so as I discover noteworthy features that I have missed or emergent problems that I should warn about I will update this review to reflect them. In the meantime, if you are considering an upgrade to the Note 3 from the previous model and are wondering if it's worth it - I say yes.",7.0,03-12-2013,9.0,3195

The Galaxy Note 3 is a great phone with great battery life and features. The screen is big and beautiful, the apps and features are great, and the battery lasts a long time. I have used the phone pretty heavily through a 12 hour shift and still had 40% left at the end of the day. Don't let the one star review fool you, any apps you do not want can simply be disabled and the magazine app that is brought up by double tapping the home button can simply be disabled by checking a few boxes (no registration necessary), going into the app settings and unchecking the option for the home button.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,King James,False,4,"Great phone but has some setbacks from Note 2. Overall this is a great phone. The resolution is second to none and the battery life is the best i've ever had on a smart phone. Additionally the touch interface is very responsive, more so than the previous Note 2. Moreover, it is also quicker than the Note 2 when bringing up apps and running apps. But, there are a few things that the Note 3 lacks in that the Note 2 had. One is that although the camera for the Note 3 is 13 megapixels and the Note 2, 8 mega pixels, the Note 2 seems to take better quality pictures. Further, the Note 2 had better low light visibility in the pictures as well. And, the camera view point seems to be more zoomed in at the furthest level from zoom on the Note 3 making me have to take a few steps extra backward to take a picture that I wouldn't have to do with the Note 2. Secondly, the video quality in low light lacks adjustment that the Note 2 had. In the Note 2, one could take a video without the flash and still decipher whats in the video pretty well. But, in the Note 3 even in a slightly dim room you cannot see what is going on in the video which makes talking videos from the phone quite frustrating. I don't know why Samsung took a step back on the camera on the Note 3 by taking away lowlight settings and replacing it with a auto adjust feature on the camera that is supposed to adjust to the different light conditions on its own. Which, it does not do very well might I add. But with that being said, the camera is not horrible, its rather on the better side of smart phone cameras. Another thing is the speaker phone isn't as loud as the Note 2's. That was something that I really enjoyed on the Note 2. Overall though, the phone is probably the best phone I've ever had and I've had the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5 along with the Note 2. The visual aspect of the display is awesome and the default storage is 32 gigs with additional 64 gigs addable storage potential. And, I appreciate the fact that one can take the back off and replace a battery or get extra batteries to charge on the side and replace when needed. In the end I'll rate the phone a 9/10 the only complaint being the camera functioning.",23.0,15-11-2013,28.0,2197
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Amazon Customer,False,5,"love it!. Yesterday I purchased the note 3 and galaxy gear. I'd really debated on the gear, but went with it, and overall I'm happy with both items. I bought the note 2 in December 2012, and it was an awesome phone. I'd spent about 10 years with BlackBerry, and then went with the Razr Maxx and its stupendous battery life. The note 2's battery life isn't even close to the droid. Other than that, I loved it, and really loved the S pen. I'm retired, so I used the pen for grocery lists, notes, quick phone #s and the like. But after an update a few months ago, my keyboard began to lag. Even Samsung didn't know what to do, and I was frustrated. When I heard about the 3 I began researching and reading reviews. Yesterday I went to verizon and traded up my note 2 to a 3. I set everything up last night and have explored some new features I didn't think I'd even use, but I saw I will love them. Magazine is one new feature. I've become a news junkie and this brings up some things I'd not find anywhere else. I am going to love the scrapbooking function - I can easily copy and save quotes, as I'm prone to do. The battery life seems very good. I took the phone of the charger about 9am. It's almost 6 and I still have 69% remaining. I've played some angry birds, and I've had the Bluetooth on all day (I'm not a person who uses Bluetooth much, but it's been on because of the galaxy gear, which at this time has 77% remaining). The note 2 would be well below 50% by this time - without the Bluetooth. The galaxy gear is simple to use. It's pretty intuitive. My only dissatisfaction is the sort distance between the note 3 and the gear needed to keep connected. I'd hoped to be able to go upstairs without my phone, but the Bluetooth disconnects. Same for a short trip to the kitchen. I keep the volume and notifications on vibrate. My wrist easily feels the vibration. Since I can't be far from the phone, I'd hear it ringing anyway! What I can't understand is the carriers not having cases for the phone. I've ordered a case from Amazon until otterboxes are in. Finally, I know some people don't like ""phablets"". I do more texting than phone. The phablet is convenient. I do a lot of Facebook from it and other web browsing. I do all of my gaming from it. I use it to read ebooks in bed. If I had to give up all of my devices but one, the one to keep would be the note. I have had virtually every tablet as well as most of the Nook and kindle ereaders, so this is saying something.

But I have small hands and my hand does get a little achy from holding the phone for a longish length of time. I knew going in that this is a big phone and that's what I wanted because it's tough to read web pages and emails and watch TV (via Slingbox) on small screens. The back of the phone has a faux-leather cover that makes the phone a little bit less slippery. The back cover is VERY thin, too--which helps make the phone alot thinner than you'd think it would be given its size. (I just compared it to a friend's iphone, and this phone is actually thinner!) Some people have rated this phone lower simply because they don't like the plastic back cover. To me, I couldn't care less what the back cover is made out of since I will be using a protective case anyway! I love to draw, and the S-pen makes it fun to doodle and even write with. Although the phone has a setting where you can make the screen more sensitive so you can use the touchscreen even with gloves on, I will use the S-pen instead because it's more precise. There are so many features on this phone that I still haven't figured most of them out yet--after all, I just got the phone yesterday. Those who have a Galaxy S4 will already be familiar with a lot of the features of the Note 3. It comes with the usual Verizon bloatware, but you can remove the icons from your screens (but not remove the programs from the phone itself). You can disable them too. This phone packs 32gb of storage plus you can add an SD card if you have lots of music, pictures and videos that you want to store on your phone. So no worries for me regarding the space that the bloatware takes up. My last phone had 8gb of storage and I never used that up, even with the bloatware. If you are new to later Android versions, you may be surprised to learn that you can no longer store programs/apps on the SD card, which can be worrisome if you have less than say, 16gb of internal storage and you like to have tons of apps on your phone.**EDIT*** This phone comes with Android 4.3. I've just discovered that it does, in fact, allow you to save some apps on the SD card! Even so, this phone has so much memory, I will be hard pressed to use most of it. So far, all my favorite apps work great on this phone, except for HBOgo and MAXgo.*2nd EDIT* HBOGO has been fixed and it now works! Still waiting for Max go to be fixed. For now, I'm happy that my Slingbox works with this phone. Because of its size, this phone is not for everyone.

I bought this phone at Costco as opposed to Amazon, but I wanted to make a quick note/warning to anyone looking to purchase this phone. The battery life after the latest android update 4.4.2 is absolutely terrible. The 'Android System' takes up about 10X as much battery as it used to and dominates the battery consumption, as opposed to the 'screen' which used to dominate consumption (as it should). Even after installing battery doctor, putting the phone on power saving mode, it's still significantly worse than before (when I did not need these options). It is purely a software issue, but an enormous one.

I've been a fan of the bigger sized phones for some time and Samsung has been paving the way in terms of quality large phones. I remember when I had the 4.5in screened Samsung Infuse and it was considered large. I've had a Note and Note 2 and loved both. Note 3 continues the tradition of keeping everything that worked, improving where needed, and adding features I wouldn't have even thought to ask. So many of the little annoyances I had with my Note 2 have been addressed. Its clear they put a lot of thought into finding out what people loved and wanted changed. When I first held the phone I fell in love. The form factor is just great and the screen is a noticeable jump up. That's saying something when the Note 2 already had a stellar screen resolution. I don't feel the need to have this one in a case. The slippery back of the Note 2 required a case as I dropped it a couple times when holding it bare. Rather than go on feature by feature I'll suffice to say everything feels like a great and noticeable improvement. S-pen, camera, battery life, screen, on and on its the phone I loved before but better in every way I could have asked for. I've tried dozens of smartphones over the past 5 years.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Paul McDonald,False,1,"stay away from galaxy note 3. So, I got this phone using ""Verizon Edge"" program - ordered over the phone. When I received it, it wouldn't activate. The SIM card number wasn't on the order. I had to pry the SIM card out of the Note 3, which is NOT an easy thing to do! I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it. I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on ""Automatic"") and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds. Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this. So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time...

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,C. Pease,False,2,"Nice features, but poor low RF signal reception. I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 from a local Verizon store. I am very disappointed with this phone. I paid full price to keep my unlimited data alive. I am finding that the RF reception is abysmal. In buildings where I used to get -89 dbm with my Motorola Droid Bionic, I get -118 dbm with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Even outdoors, with the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, I don't get that great of a 4G LTE signal. The phone will usually then switch to 1 to 2 bars of 3G and stay there until I am back in a really strong 4G area. I'm thinking either the antenna is of poor quality or the radio is not very sensitive - or both. I may have to return this phone and try the LG G2. This GN3 cannot even begin to compete with my old Motorola Droid Bionic when it comes to holding on to a less than perfect signal. In strong signal areas there is no problem, but when the signal isn't the best, the GN3 does a poor job of holding the 4G LTE signal. My Motorola Droid Bionic used to do an outstanding job in the same exact places this GN3 fails. The screen is brilliant, and you couldn't ask for a more feature packed phone. The sound quality is good and volume level is great, but above all the GN3 has to be able to connect to a signal to be a great phone. In the near future, Verizon is going to Voice over LTE (VoLTE). This means that our phone conversations will now be carried on the 4G LTE band. That really scares me with my GN3, since it can't maintain a 4G LTE signal unless I'm really in a strong signal area.",72.0,27-10-2013,82.0,1565

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,soufiane,False,1,"EASY simple and you feel like being a happy free .... This is just ridiculous! The phone is locked to Verizon and you can't use it with any other mobile service even if you get the full priced one (no contract). This is absurd! T-mobile (part European company) gives you full power over your phone. You buy a phone from them and on your request you can unlock it by sending you an email code. EASY simple and you feel like being a happy free customer who can make his own cognitive choice. Now these companies (Verizon, At&T) want to treat you like a child who can't make up his mind. They want to lock every single aspect to never leave them. This is ridiculous. I called Verizon specialists many times and each one has its own version of the story: one guy told me you don't have to worry your phone will work with any SIM, one lady was trying to figure out what unlock means - she thought my screen was locked - then she put me on indefinite hold ... one told me you can use it internationally but within US it's locked - so within the same company, no one seems to know what's going on in their own space. Ludicrous. So avoid buying any phone except if it's International or T-mobile then you have your freedom to use it anywhere. The phone Samsung Note 4 is AWESOME. I will get it sooner than later. But I am sad I had to return the phone to Amazon ... I want a Note 4 so bad :)",1.0,07-11-2014,3.0,1383

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Marsha W. Maxwell,False,1,"Really disappointed with this phone. I have had this smartphone for a few months now and I continue to be disappointed with how buggy and unreliable it is. I constantly have problems getting the phone and headset features work consistently. Also, the phone is a power hog, even with the large battery. I have constantly having to turn off features like WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS, etc. when not using them or I have no chance of getting through the day on one charge. When the battery does get low -- below 5% -- the phone has to be powered off to charge or it will shut itself down, even if it is connected to a charger. One of the most irritating features is that you have to enter your password to turn the phone ringer on or off. I do like the large screen but that is about the ONLY thing I like about this device. I will be moving back to an iPhone when they release their larger screens later this year.",5.0,03-04-2014,7.0,904
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Roger G. Laird,False,1,"Purchase Insurance. I was excited to purchase this device since before it came out. I did a lot of research and waited quite a few months before upgrading from my Galaxy S3. Initially I was satisfied with the device. 10 days after purchasing the device; however, I am stuck paying more money to replace it. Normally I do not purchase insurance on devices and luckily the phone company put it on without asking me. I did not drop or put any excessive pressure on the phone to damage it. I set the device on the counter and when I picked it up a few minutes later the screen was malfunctioning. Having 14 days to take it back to the provider I tried that first. I was informed that there was a pressure crack in the LCD and that apparently I had caused it. Knowing that I had not done anything to cause it I became very upset. I was told that I could send it to the provider but if they determined that the phone was damaged I would have to pay full retail for the replacement refurbished device they replaced mine with. The other option was paying the $100 deductible for my insurance and not knowing exactly what was wrong with the device. I turned to Samsung to solve this delima. They looked at the phone and determined the LCD was cracked, said that I caused the damage to the device and it would cost over $200 to repair. Now I have a device that I did not damage and must pay an insurance deductible on to replace. I asked how to file a complaint with Samsung about this and they said I cannot. After further researching this specific issue I have found that this is actually a common issue with this device. It can actually occur due to temperature changes in the device that are considered normal operating temperatures. I have to note that I loved my Galaxy S3. It was why I stayed with a Samsung device. I was even considering buying a Samsung television because I love my old phone so much. The S3 was durable as hell. I musthave dropped it 100 times before the front glass cracked, the LCD still works flawlessly. Apparently the quality of their products are not uniform across the company and they don't stand behind their products even when they should be under warranty. I will NEVER purchase another product from them again. Be cautious when making a purchase from them.",14.0,04-02-2014,19.0,2285
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Paul McDonald,False,1,"stay away from galaxy note 3!. So, I got this phone using ""Verizon Edge"" program - ordered over the phone. When I received it, it wouldn't activate. The SIM card number wasn't on the order. I had to pry the SIM card out of the Note 3, which is NOT an easy thing to do! I had to do this to read the SIM card number to Verizon Wireless, so they could activate it. I noticed that when I had device on maximum brightness (NOT on ""Automatic"") and was working on something over extended amount of time, the brightness would dim for a few seconds, then return to max. This would keep happening, at random intervals, and to seemingly random brightness levels. If I continued still to use it... say after 45 minutes or something, it would dim to MINIMUM brightness for few seconds. Now, it wouldn't show me or tell me in any way what brightness level it was changing to... I could just tell when it was putting to MINIMUM brightness. I got it replaced for another Note 3... The replacement had same issue... I called Verizon Wireless and then they revealed to me that this was a feature built into device by the manufacturer. I even spoke to Samsung to verify this. So, stay away from the Galaxy Note 3 at ALL COSTS! ANYONE that owned this device might need to operate the device on maximum brightness for extended amount of time...

"Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Black 32GB (Verizon Wireless)",Samsung,Dagansinferno,False,1,"Garbage Phone. I traded in my iPhone 5 because I thought this phone looked great in-store. I previously owned phones --way back-- like the Omnia,and was hesitant about the Samsungs again. The size of the phone is about the only redeeming value. It's a big screen, yes. But, other than that the rest is downhill. Call Quality: Horrble! I never had an issue with my other iPhones, or phones. This sounds like I'm calling from a bathtub. That is, when it's not dropping my calls (on Verizon, too!) Try it on speakerphone? Ha! Good luck. Call quality takes another enormous dive. Responsiveness: It lags a lot for me, applications are often slow. Graphics and Pictures: Pictures are pretty decent. Not bad. I get a lot of black screens and have to restart applications. When I go from say a Twitter link to something else, it's black, slow to load. I thought the phone would be blazing fast, but it's way below any iPhone or even other phones. My wife has the LG G2, and while it's supposed to be fast (LG G2) it makes the Galaxy Note III look abysmally slow. Overall, I'm greatly disappointed in this phone. I switched because I think it had great promise as an ""all-in-one"" type phone, but not for me. I'm going to trade the phone back in for something else and likely take an incredibly big financial hit for buying this piece of garbage.",7.0,22-12-2013,9.0,1337
