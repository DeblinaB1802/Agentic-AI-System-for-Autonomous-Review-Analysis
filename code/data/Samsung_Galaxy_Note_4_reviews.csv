Cosmetically this phone is in pristine condition!! But after days two of use, I started to have issues with the phone and they have only been getting worse and irritating me. It constantly freezes, reboots for no reason, gets stuck on reboot screen, non responsive a lot of times!! Since I received the phone, its been a useless POS because I can't use the minimum features of the Note 5, such as make/receive a call much less text!

This phone is a great value with all the bells and whistles I love about the notes. I've had the note 2, 3 and now the 4, it just gets faster, more features, more memory and better cameras. The particular one I got only charges up to 77 percent with the stock battery, but it's refurbished so not unexpected.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,Tito Martinez,True,2,"""Tested for Full function, R2/Ready for Reuse"". Pretty clean for a used phone. The screen scratched a little but nothing that you wouldn't get from normal ware. No evidence of serious drops. No evidence of water damage. Power, volume and home buttons still have some nice action. Came with a battery that had no signs of damage or bloating. All the makings of a great used cellular device...if it ever turned on. After using different chargers, cords and replacement batteries (3 to be exact) known to be good; still no power whatsoever. Deeply sadden and curious what it takes to pass a quality check.

All it did was show the start up screen for a few seconds and then go to a black screen over and over and over and over again.

When I saw the oppurtunity to jump to the 4 for a decent price, I jumped at it... but boy do I regret that. The thing hasn't worked well since day one, even after getting support to help me with the device in the first few weeks. I eventually gave up on trying to have it work well.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,habanero,True,4,"Powerful, feature-rich, quality phone. Overall experience has been good since I purchased it in late November. I use it a lot for general web browsing and email. I was a little anxious about TouchWiz with all the negative comments in press reviews but I don't find anything wrong with it (coming from htc evo 4g). Battery life has been fantastic compared to my old phone. I can go days without charging and the charger is very fast. The email app seems to work well with S/MIME email which my old phone didn't. I've toyed with the SPen some and think it will be useful with a little practice. I still use a Daytimer at work and wonder if this can replace it. Love the ability to cut and paste images and take screen shots. The ability to hand write notes should make shopping lists and memos very convenient. The SPen accessory kit was missing from the box so I'm a bit miffed about that. The phone size is good for me. Fits in my pocket fine. I can dial the phone and other basic stuff with one hand (I'm 6'1 male). I usually use two hands for email, web browsing, messaging, etc but I would on any size phone. People tell me it sounds better than my old phone. I find the white one quite classy in appearance and the build quality seems good. Unlike some press reviews, I wouldn't call it cheesy at all, plastic back or not. And its a lot nicer than a certain new fruit product which I find slippery as ice. Amazon had the best deal right after Thanksgiving (199) when it was still 299 (and sold out) in all the stores around here.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,Johnny_Amazon®,False,5,"A Nearly Perfect Big Phone - But Is It A Worthy Upgrade Over Your Phone?. I've only had a little time to use this, so this is just my general overview. For technical specifications and professional reviews, there is always ""Google it."" To make this review as efficient as possible, I will do a quick run-over, and also a comparison with other phones you might be most interested in comparing it to, especially the Note 3 that it replaces, the iPhone 6 Plus, the LG G3 since it shares more than a few similarities, and even the new upcoming Note 4 Edge. Physical: * The Note 4 is basically a Note 3 - if you've held one before, then you'll feel right at home. It's just a smidge taller, narrower, thicker, and heavier. But the main thing you'll notice is the design difference. Looking at it straight down onto the screen side, you might not notice much, but set it down and view it on all sides and you'll see a much better difference. It's like having a same car but the 2015 version over the 2014 version - at first you don't see any difference, until you go up close and realize the little things that make it really stand out. First of all, Samsung has finally paid attention to its best aesthetic competitor HTC, and followed suit with a real aluminum metal chamfered edges, and not the fake aluminum of the Note 3. It looks great. View it from the top and bottom edges, and you'll see an even more striking design change and upgrade. View it from the top edge especially and you'll see what I mean. Here is the first Samsung with truly beautiful edges - I would have never thought I would say that! *The very next thing you'll notice once you turn it on is the screen. the LG G3 was the first QHD screen for America from a big company, but I can say that Samsung's AMOLED has come a long way, and is now the best on the market. The color gamut, saturation, contrast and black levels have always been great, but Samsung has also come a long way in terms of color reproduction, and especially making the screen still looking great in direct sunlight - it's only been two years since the Note 2, but Samsung has made amazing progress. QHD means 2560 x 1440 resolution - 515 ppi - and Samsung's is the brightest, clearest, and best screen on the planet right now. *Other notable improvements are: - Processor: upgraded Exynos and Snapdragon processors depending on where you buy it, upgrade GPU for you gaming aficionados. The Note 3 was one of the fastest and most powerful for its time, and is still one of the fastest phones right now(!), and yet the Note 4 is even faster! Swiping through screens, switching between apps, running a dozen apps, playing processing-intensive games, they all feel like a breeze. - Upgraded cameras: 16MP on the back, 3.7MP on the front(instead of 13MP and 2MP). You can now record video in 4K mode! - The pen/stylus is now made by Wacom, the famous stylus maker. Hardware and software improvements have made it more usable than ever. - Samsung got rid of the USB 3 charging port of the Note 3 in favor of the more universal mini-USB 2, but improvements have made it possible to charge the battery from 0%-50% in 30 minutes. The battery is 3220mAh, up from 3200 in the Note 3. Both will get you through a whole day of moderate usage with a bunch to spare. I've never had it lower than 20% remaining using it from 10am-10pm with moderate to heavy usage. What you should know if you didn't already is that the screen uses the most battery. Keep leaving it on and it will drain fast, especially if you're playing a game. Other big battery hogs are leaving your GPS radio on - even if you are not actively using it - and apps that continually access your phone - like if you set your email to instant retrieval instead of every few hours. By itself, this phone is a beast in many senses of the word. But how does it compare with the other phones, and is it a worthy buy or upgrade? In comparison with the iPhone 6 Plus: If you want a giant phone, the iPhone 6 Plus is a very intriguing option. If you're an Apple person, you're going to get this phone, that's just the truth. It has a beautiful 1080p screen(a very first for Apple), it's fast, and finally Apple has a phone that all Apple lovers who have been craving for a huge phone to have. The Apple ecosystem is still superior in terms of apps and userability. On the other hand, if you like Samsung, then you should absolutely get the Note 4. Samsung now has an almost perfect big phone, and each phone from now on will only get better. You will never regret getting this phone. If you're in the neutral, then it depends on your lifestyle. If you just want a big phone for everyday use, I personally think it's easier to use Apple phones. Everything is just right there - the learning curve is not very steep(until you get into iTunes and want to export stuff, but that's another issue). But if you want more control over your phone and you're more tech savvy, there is nothing better than the Android ecosystem - it has the best of all worlds, and for those more tech savvy, it's actually easier to use than Apple phones. As a user of both ecosystems, I can attest to this personally. In comparison with the LG G3: I wanted to include the G3 because both share the QHD-resolution screens. But the G3 is more compact, having smaller bezels and a smaller 5.5"" screen. So if you still want a big phone, but feel the Note phones were just a tad too big, then the G3 has that perfect combination. It also has one of the best screens on the market, in LCD form, has a beautiful design, and the LG quality. In comparison with the Note 4 Edge: Personally for me, there is no comparison - I'm going to get and use the Note 4 Edge as my main phone. It has a smaller 5.6"" screen, but that curve and design makes it oh so unique - it's the most unique and best-looking phone for me by far. Some will complain that with that form factor it will be very hard to have a case that can fully protect it, but so I will just be extra careful with it. In comparison with the Note 3: This might be most important comparison, because you own a Note 3. Moving from the Note 2 to Note 3 was easy for me, because my Not 2 had performance issues that my Note 3 doesn't(it would slow to a crawl when too many apps are installed/used, and when your text history is too large texting crawls to a stand still), plus the 1080p screen on the Note 3 is 10x better than the 720p Note 2's, not in just resolution, but brightness, color reproduction, sun-light legibility, etc. The differences from the Note 3 to the Note 4 is less pronounced, since at this size QHD over FHD resolution is not so pronounced - although if you put them side by side you will notice the difference. My advice is, if you resell your Note 3, then absolutely upgrade to the Note 4. If you can't, or can't upgrade and have to buy the Note 4 at full price, then I would say to wait until the Note 5. Or do what I will do, and get the Note 4 Edge. By itself, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is a definite recommendation. As an upgrade, it is still highly recommended, with caveats. I will add to the review once I have used it more.",36.0,17-10-2014,46.0,7153
"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,JC,False,5,"Best Phone hands down.. I've had a cracked S3 ever since my new employee decided to walk through a GM plant while on his cellphone. Spun around so fast the S3 never saw it coming. Short of this story is that i've waited a LONG time to choose my new phone. I've read (p)reviews for months held out and decided against the HTC M8, LG G3 and GS5. The final competitor was the Nexus 6 (No, I have never bought into the Apple ecosystem so the Iphone wasn't an option for me). I knew he Nexus 6 was going to be the Notes best challenge to date, why? Well let me explain my reasoning for switching to a Phablet before I get into that. Skip the next two paragraphs if you're already sold on the Phablet idea. The cellphone market is saturated. Devices are begging to look all the same to me, besides a few leading specs a lot of what's out there fits the same form factor. When purchasing a phone I tried to think two years out. A few months ago I made the decision that I would embrace the wearable market. I held out for months and bought a Moto360. Why is this relevant? I see the Moto360 pairing beautifully with a phablet. After using it for 2 weeks I take my phone out of my pocket considerably less. Phablets are for power users, as a project manager the Note's large size and processing power will allow me to get work done faster in the field, but as a consumer I didn't want to dig in my pocket for every notification. Let me tell you this. The moto will make your phone experience better. It's like you broke your phone into two parts, the wearable and the powerful. I can only imaging the technological advancements of the next two years that will marry these two together even better. Back to the Nexus. Why the Note4 instead? I'm a phablet newbie, seeing that google's phone was bigger, heavier and thicker was an instant turn off. Yes true blooded android fans all seem to collectively HATE touchwiz, but I was okay with it. Also, true blooded android fans root and root often. I also hold the belief that Android L will improve touchwiz. So we have big phones and then we have googles bigger phone. Next factor, price. I am getting my Note cheaper than the sticker price of the Nexus, how? Samsung had a friends and family discount in which pre-orders were gifted up to $200 for any working phone. That's right, this little old S3 made it to the end of its life and now reduced my phones cost by almost 28%. Googles bigger, heavier and now more expensive. The last thing working against the Nexus was time. I can't get my hands on one for a month and by then the note offer would have been well over. Yes, I sacrificed true android, an easy to upgrade and silky smooth experience, but I can feel safe knowing that other rooters will be making beautiful skins for this phone as they always do. The winner for me was Samsung and the Note 4. My GS3 did so well and took a beating so Samsung has earned my respect. Pros: I use the S-Pen FAR more than I thought that I would. It's not a gimmick and is useful on Job sites or during calls. Taking notes during phonecalls allow you to reference them later on. Battery life is great and the fast charger makes up for any of the shortcomings in that department. IR Blaster is actually pretty amazing. I can control any TV within minutes. Display is beautiful. If you are interested in VR the Note can be used with a $200 device that samsung just released. Cons: None yet Sidenote: LG-G3 was competitive by spec but I didn't like the color scheme and screen display. The colors seemed washed out and I was instantly turned off by it. I kept thinking that it was too dim. The colors definitely didn't pop. PLEASE ask questions below. I take pride in my reviews and would be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Also, please press like if helpful. Happy shopping and best of luck in your decision!",16.0,10-12-2014,21.0,3855

I fully expected to buy the S6, but after learning there was no micro sd slot and the battery was not removable I skipped it and went to the Note. If I wanted an Apple product I would buy and Iphone! I expected the Note 4 to be the same to operate, as my Galaxy Tab is, which is the same as the S4, and I love it. But. No. It has a different set up, not intuitive, and difficult to find simple features. For instance changing the ring tone on txt msg was an exercise in research, I was shocked, didn't expect it to be so damned difficult. There are features that I loved about my S4, and fully expected from the Note 4 that are just gone or so damned hard to navigate that I can't find them.

But they touted the camera and its image stabalization etc. Taking photos of dogs laying relatively still on the couch it is rarely crisp. Taking a photo of a red hot air ballon against a crisp blue sky isnt crisp either! I dont know why. I upgraded from my Note 2 because my Note 2 had the equivalent of a blue screen of death after an auto update that neither sprint nor samsung could fix. It didnt check for space before updating and never could connect to a cell tower again. Maybe i ought research if my camera problem is standard... it sucks. I have to take 8 to 10 photos to get 1 clear photo. Sometimes. Slow to take shots Harder to swap between flash than note 2 I prefer manually selecting what kind of photo mode i am in most of the time. I want especially need to be able to select speed mode or portrait mode. Lastly i have that extra fast (upgraded towers) in my area and the spinning icon to indicate that is annoying. Attention is drawn to that which moves. I figure that will be fixed in a later update.,1.0,16-12-2014,3.0,1095
"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,DrRuthie,False,5,Gotta love it.... I've had the phone for about 2 days now as a replacement to my 3 year old Motorola Photon. My feelings of the phone may be skewed since I only paid around $100 due to Samsung's/BB $200 trade-in deal. I am super happy with my purchase. My current best feature: EVERYTHING My current worst feature: Unable to turn off the camera's burst feature. My husband has the Note3 and he's insanely jealous of the new baby. I've not used much of anything accessories-wise except the headphones once. They are a nice quality and have no issues so far. I'll update more after more use....,3.0,24-10-2014,5.0,592
"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,Gabriel B. Grant,False,1,"No more simultaneous data and voice like you had on the Note 2 & 3. This is a great phone, but there's one real drawback the was a big surprise for me after purchase. I can no longer surf or use data while talking on the Sprint network. Why not? The Note 4 only has one radio. The Note 2 and 3 had two radios. At some time X in the future, Sprint will turn on VOIP and this will be resolved, but until that date, I will wish I hadn't ""upgraded"". Operating only one radio avoids interference and extends the battery life. More so, this won't be an issue once the network technology is upgraded to support VOIP. I suspect these are the reasons for the change. Nevertheless, it really stinks that I no longer have the functionality I've frequently used and enjoyed for 2+ years. More so, I must have read 20+ Note 4 reviews and comparisons and no one reported this drawback. If you have wifi available, then this isn't an issue, regardless of whether or not you turn on wifi calling. You can talk on the voice network and surf via wifi, or talk and surf over wifi. It's simply that Sprint doesn't yet allow VOIP on the LTE network (voice over LTE). Verizon has VOIP enabled over LTE. I'm not a user on other services, but I believe Verizon and Sprint's CDMA networks were the one's that didn't allow simultaneous talk and data. Now that Verizon's LTE network allows VOIP, this is likely only a Sprint problem. Otherwise, I love the phone. I'm differentiating my review with one star in hope that others take notice and can be aware of what they're giving up before they make the choice to ""upgrade"".",75.0,24-10-2014,85.0,1596

"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,King James,False,4,"Note 4 vs. Note 3 ....... improved but still missing somethings. I will write this review in comparison to last years Note 3 which I had as well. I will compare the sound, the UI, the display, and camera. 1. Sound: I have to say that the most disappointing aspect of the Note series is the sound quality. I have used the HTC one M8 HK and the iphone 6 plus and they both have better sound (quality + volume) both in the ear piece and in the speaker. As far as the sound coming from the speakers is concerned, the speakers were moved to the back as opposed to the Note 3's speakers at the bottom (which is a better placement). I am baffled by this decision. Why in the hell would speakers be put on the back of the phone? So that you can disturb people sitting in front of you as well as having to turn the volume louder just to hear sound from the phone. I understand the engineering aspect may have had to sacrifice for the design but come on, in this day and age where HTC can put speakers in the front and Apple and even Blackberry can put them on the bottom of the phone, this decision irks me the most. I'm an audiophile, so while the Note 3 had speakers at the bottom allowing me to tolerate the lack of sound quality, the Note 4 places the speakers in the back of the phone causing me to constantly either choose my iphone 6 plus or my HTC one M8. 2. The screen on this phone is pretty much the best in the industry right now, hands down. I don't want to get into specs here but the screen is top notch and color reproduction is great. With that being said, I see minimal difference between the Note 3's display when compared to the Note 4's display. I'm a stickler for details so it means something to me, but for the average phone user the difference is negligible. 3. The UI is the UI, Touch wiz. Touch wiz sucks, everyone on the surface of the earth knows this. But there are some improvements between the 3 and the 4, mainly the S pen. Samsung improved the sensitivity in the pen to where it actually feels like i'm writing with a real pen. The strokes and the line reproduction is almost exact to if one was using a real pen. If you're a Note 3 user and use the S pen a lot this is enough of a reason to switch over, if not then really I really don't see much of a difference in the UI of the Note 3 and Note 4 except maybe some minor changes to the side panel app shortcuts. Yawn. On a side note, the fingerprint sensor works pretty well despite the criticism it received. I actually get about 80 percent accuracy on it. 4. The Camera: I think the most improved part of the phone from the Note 3 to the Note 4 is the camera. I absolutely hated the Note 3's camera. It was horrible in low light situations and it could not take a clear shot, unless everything was still, for the life of the camera. The Note 4's camera on the other hand is incredible. It has drastically improved its visibility and quality of pictures in low light settings. Additionally, the optical image stabilization which is embedded in the hardware not the software, creates clear pictures even when there is movement during the shot. If I had to put a number on it, i'd say the camera is 80 percent better on the Note 4 than on the Note 3. Moreover, the best added feature in my mind is the wide angle selfie mode. My friends who have iphones and other phones were jealous that I could take such wide selfies to include many more objects/people into the front facing camera pics. Overall, the quality of the pictures in daylight are only matched by the iphone 6 plus. Overall, I really like the Note 4. I do like it better than the Note 3 because of the better camera. Furthermore, the build quality is 100 percent better than the Note 3's corny plastic design. I use the Note series because they are the best phones that can open up and have replacement batteries put into them. I basically am always juiced up and ready to go. And, I put in a 64gb micro sd card and I have enough space on my phone to do whatever I please (music, videos, pics, etc). I remember when I had the Note 2 (one of my all time favorite phones) and I was constantly getting jokes and comments about the size of the phone. Now, nobody even notices what phone I carry anymore with the Note 4. The days of the phablet sized phones being the butt of jokes are over. Thanks apple.",2.0,18-12-2014,4.0,4339
"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,Brian Wentworth,False,5,"Fantastic phone. I love this phone. I upgraded from Galaxy S2 so much of what I like would probably apply to all the big screen phones like 6plus and G3. I chose Samsung for the stylus, removable battery and sd card, and their longer experience with the Note series. So here are the best features: 1. Voice recognition - I am dictating most emails and texts now, big time saver. I think the performance is amazing compared to older phones. 2. Speedy processor - everything seems to load pretty fast on this phone, even with multitasking. Podcasts and Web audio don't get interrupted. 3. Big screen is a pleasure! Great for multi-window feature, also for videos and just large fonts. The keyboard is nice size with numbers on same screen as letters. 4. Stylus - I enjoy the stylus as an alternative to the finger for small buttons. Also using for cut and paste and screen shots. Not using the writing capability much yet, but it takes awhile to master all the features ! 5. Fingerprint reader is a nice convenience for screen unlock. They say Apple implementation is better but this is much more workable than the naysayers would have you believe. 6. Fast charging is a nice new capability. I am not that impressed with battery life, but the fast charging and removable battery compensate nicely. NEGATIVES 1.Speaker placement on the back is not great, as many have complained about since Note 3. Overall, I am very happy thus far. I haven't even used the camera much yet, but will update the review as I exolore further.",8.0,07-11-2014,10.0,1520
"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Frosted White 32GB (Sprint)",Samsung,Quentin Moore,False,5,"The best big smartphone available. I owned the original Galaxy Note, plus I owned the Galaxy Note 2. Thus I’ve been using big phones, or phablets, long before it was cool to do so. I still recall people calling my Note 1 an “iPad Phone” and snickering. Oh how times have changed. I was excited to get my hands on the Galaxy Note 4. I figured it would be everything I liked about the Note 2, plus it would be bigger, faster, with a better screen, and with a better camera. The Note 4 didn’t disappoint. Here are my thoughts on the phone: ✔ Pros: - Gorgeous, big screen. Best display on any smartphone - Fast performance - Stylus pen support - Good camera (low light not as good as the iPhone 6 Plus though) - Great battery life - Can basically replace the need for a small tablet ✔ Cons: - Maybe a tad big for some - Pen is good only if you bother to use it - Cost more than other good options - Would have kept it if it had software like the Droid Turbo/Moto X ✔ Bottom Line I really, really, really like the Note 4. It’s really the best big phone you can buy. I prefer it to the iPhone 6 Plus, even though I also like the 6 Plus very much. The most compelling features to me is the big, gorgeous screen and the awesome battery life. I did however return the Note 4 in exchange for the Droid Turbo. The Turbo doesn’t have as good a screen or as good a camera as the Note 4. The Turbo’s screen is smaller. The Turbo doesn’t offer pen support. I actually would recommend the Note 4 over the Droid Turbo to most people. So why did I trade the Note 4 for the Droid Turbo? Moto Apps! Once you embrace Moto Assist, Moto Voice, Moto Display, Moto Actions, and Trusted Devices, you won’t use a phone that don’t have these apps. While I do feel like the Note 4 is the best smartphone available, I encourage people to try the Droid Turbo or Moto X and give the Moto Apps a spin. You may also decide that you don’t need the best phone.",4.0,07-11-2014,6.0,1924
