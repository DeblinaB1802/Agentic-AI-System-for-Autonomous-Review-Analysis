Quality of the camera is really good, but the speaker is located at the bottom of the device, it's not at upper right corner which is closed to our ear !

"Xiaomi Mi A3 128GB + 4GB RAM, Triple Camera, 4G LTE Smartphone - International Global Version (Not just Blue)",Xiaomi,Tab,True,4,"Excellent for the cost. I am trying to train myself not to expect so much from a phone in this price bracket. However, I am warming up to this phone. I have never used Android One before. I kind of miss MIUI. MIUI is awesome. I may go back to a model that has it if I can't get used to Android One. It's not that it's bad it's just not what I am accustomed to. There are a few missing functions but there are some nice additions too. Also, the camera is better than you'd expect. It does seem to do some things slower than my mate 9. It takes too long to download apps sometimes. It hangs every once in a while. I'm hoping the Dec update addresses this. Over all I am okay with this purchase. This phone is very pixel like in the UI.",3.0,04-12-2019,5.0,733

"Xiaomi Mi A3 128GB + 4GB RAM, Triple Camera, 4G LTE Smartphone - International Global Version (Not just Blue)",Xiaomi,Douglas P.,True,5,"Lots of bang for your buck with minor gripes.. Wonderful phone for the price and Android ONE is a fine os. The camera shoots great photos, lacking a bit in low light conditions though. I find the finger print reader to be less than reliable but work keeps my hands rather dirty so that could just be me. Dual SIM or expansion slot, but who needs it at 128gb storage. The lower res screen hasn't been a bother to me at all and the screen is rather easy to see on sunny days. The IR blaster sounds gimmicky but I find it to be a very useful addition. I've owned the mi a1 and 2, xiaomi seems to make quality phones. My only real gripe for the phone would be The charging port and headphone jack are on opposite ends of the phone. Finger print reader isn't on par compared to my a1 and my camera app gives me a crash notification after I plug it in 75% of the time (doesn't seem to effect the camera but the notification is annoying). Do your research to see if the specs match your needs but you can't really beat this phone with a nice case and 2 screen protectors for 200$.",0.0,18-12-2019,2.0,1073

"Xiaomi Mi A3 128GB + 4GB RAM, Triple Camera, 4G LTE Smartphone - International Global Version (Not just Blue)",Xiaomi,Chris,True,3,"Good value but not perfect. I'm a big Xiaomi fan and I wanted to like this but had to return it for a few reasons. #1. The EIS (electronic image stabilization) for video implemented in the software is basically non-functional in any of the resolutions in the Xiaomi camera. It may have just been me but it just didn't work unlike with my Redmi Note 7. This was the deal breaker defect that made me send the phone back. #2. The screen resolution though AMOLED is 720p. The color temperature is non-adjustable and it's very warm. When you can take pictures and video in 1080p and 4k it doesn't make sense to view them in 720p. Not to mention the screen in grainy; as one reviewer said somewhere, it's as f you can see the individual pixels. #3. Android One isn't all that. Think you'll like stock Android? Get ready to give up all of the little enhancements that the vendor adds to Android that makes it so entertaining and handy. The plus side! #1. The processor, the battery life, memory, and camera are all excellent as well as the build quality of the phone itself. #2. This phone is able to work easily with the Google Camera app that was modified for it (See XDA Developers for more info on GCam). This phone with the Pixel's portrait mode and night sight is a dream come true. Pixel features at Xiaomi prices. Overall, a phone with good bones but an ugly screen and a video recording software glitch. This is a rare misstep for Xiaomi but it's still a good value.",22.0,23-09-2019,27.0,1468
"Xiaomi Mi A3 128GB + 4GB RAM, Triple Camera, 4G LTE Smartphone - International Global Version (Not just Blue)",Xiaomi,Ben M.,True,5,"Super value for money. I have been impressed with this phone. It costs a fraction of the amount of the established brands and works really well. I am still getting around to configuring some of the finer points on the Android version installed. The only gripe is that the screen does not appear as bright as I expect in bright sunlight but that may just be my setup. I really like the crisp screen and camera, and the big 128GB memory! And the speed. Watching Netflix on the phone is super smooth and clear. The remote blaster is really convenient too. I bought two of these phones (one for my daughter) and she is also impressed. I did not look carefully at the specs and assumed that the protective case I was buying would fit. It didn't because the A3 and A3 Lite are different sizes. Overall this is a lovely phone which I can recommend. Make sure you buy the screen protectors too. I managed to scratch mine by the end of the day.

"Xiaomi Mi A3 128GB + 4GB RAM, Triple Camera, 4G LTE Smartphone - International Global Version (Not just Blue)",Xiaomi,Nadav Har'El,False,5,"A worthy successor to the great line of Android One phones. I got the Xiaomi A3 as a successor for a Xiaomi A1. The A1 was a fantastic phone for its price (a third of ""flagship"" phones from other companies) and the A3 is a worthy successor. The A3 improves on the A1 in several areas such as bigger storage (128 GB), better cameras (especially the selfie camera), bigger battery (4000 mAh) and faster charging (18W). It also has some more arguable changes like a OLED display instead of LCD (the jury is still out on which is better - each has different strengths) with a lower resolution (I was worried about the resolution, but in reality the resolution is good enough), fingerprint sensor in the front (I really loved the one on the back which was super-quick, but the one in the front is ok too...), and the glass instead of metal in the back. Thank god that after the wrong turn with the A2, Xioami kept the separate earphone jack in the A3 (although they moved it to the top of the phone). If you're getting this phone for your kids (which I wholeheartedly recommend), they'll love the stylish new look of this phone compared to the ""older"" design of the A1 - plus it has all those cool features the kids love to compare (your phone only has two cameras in the back? my A3 has three! I have 128 GB storage! your phone has those ugly bezels, mine doesn't!). One thing you should be aware of before buying this phone is the real story of its size. Xiaomi calls this a 6.1"" phone, which sounds significantly bigger than the A1's 5.5"". But it is NOT bigger. In fact, it is a smaller phone - it is narrower. Also its viewable screen area is smaller! The viewable screen is taller (without making the phone taller, because the bezels are gone) but it is narrower, resulting in a longer diagonal (this 6.1"" number) but a bit smaller screen area. There's nothing wrong with the bit-longer-but-bit-narrower screen but don't buy this phone expecting it's even bigger than the A1 - it is not. For better (easier to hold in one hand!) and for worse (if you were looking for a huge screen).",1.0,30-11-2019,3.0,2083
