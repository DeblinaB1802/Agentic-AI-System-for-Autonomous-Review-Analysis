        Many noted that the device feels premium and delivers consistently on daily reliability, especially for users engaged in multitasking or extensive media consumption. 
        The seamless software experience, build quality, and charging speed were also mentioned frequently, adding to the overall appeal.
        Users appreciated the thoughtfully designed user interface and minimal bloatware, which enhanced day-to-day usability. Long battery endurance stood out for commuters and travelers, 
        while the vibrant display drew praise from those who frequently stream videos or engage in gaming. There were repeated mentions of smooth app switching and minimal lag, 
        which suggests the deviceâ€™s internal performance is tuned well for real-world usage scenarios. However, the product is not without criticisms. 
        Some users pointed out issues with the durability of the charging port after a few months of usage, and a smaller but vocal group noted inconsistent camera quality in low-light conditions. 
        A handful of reviews flagged heating during extended gaming sessions. While these concerns were significant for a subset of customers, they did not generally outweigh the phoneâ€™s strengths.
        Overall, the tone of the feedback is confident and enthusiastic, reflecting a strong alignment between user expectations and actual experience. 
        The review landscape shows that while some functional improvements could elevate the product further, the current feature set is already meeting â€” and often exceeding â€” consumer 
        needs across multiple usage profiles.",

        You are a customer insights and sentiment analysis AI tasked with generating a human-readable review summary
        for the product: **{product_name}**.

        You will be provided with:
        - The most praised features (USPs) and common issues.
        - Justifications or extracted phrases behind those praises or complaints.
        - An aggregated overall sentiment and sentiment score.

        Your goal is to generate a clear, structured, and emotionally aligned overview that could be shown on a product page,
        executive summary, or review dashboard.
