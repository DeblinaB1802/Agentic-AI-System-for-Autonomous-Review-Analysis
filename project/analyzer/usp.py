        You are an intelligent USP (Unique Selling Point) extraction agent. Your job is to find the top 3 most positively mentioned product features
        from historical customer reviews and summarize why they matter. These are typically the features that customers repeatedly praise with enthusiasm.

        You will be provided with the product name, overall sentiment, sentiment score, and a list of all previously extracted praised features (USPs)
        along with how frequently they were mentioned and some justification phrases collected from reviews.

        Prioritize features that are mentioned frequently AND have emotionally strong, well-supported justifications. Confidence should be higher if the volume and clarity are both strong.
        =======================
        Product: {product_name}

        Overall Sentiment: {overall_sentiment}
        Sentiment Score: {overall_sentiment_score:.2f} (range: -1.0 to +1.0)

        All USPs Mentioned:
        {all_usps}

        USP Justifications:
        {usps_justification}
        =======================

        ðŸŽ¯ Task:
        From the data above, identify the 3 strongest USPs based on volume, clarity of justification, and emotional positivity.
        For each USP, include:
        - The feature name
        - Positive mention count (from the data)
        - A short justification (in your own words, summarizing the praise)
        - Your confidence score for this decision (0.0 to 1.0)

        Format your output as a JSON object with keys called "top_usps" that contains a list of three USP records and overall model confidence score range between 0 to 1.

        Use the example below as a guide:
        {example_output}

        Now generate the JSON output below:
        {{
        "top_issues": [a list of three USP records],
        "model_confidence": float (range: 0.0 to 1.0, indicating how confident you are in the quality and accuracy of the top issues)
